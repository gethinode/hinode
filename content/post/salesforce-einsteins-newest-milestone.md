[Salesforce Einstein](https://www.salesforce.com/products/einstein/overview/) has been proving the relevance and effectiveness of AI for business for a while now, and it just hit a major benchmark in terms of adoption: 80+ Billion AI-powered predictions per day!
We’ve [covered Einstein Prediction Builder (EPB) before](https://medium.com/creme-de-la-crm/getting-to-know-ai-einstein-prediction-builder-9bab65ba87d0); it’s a tremendous tool for sales departments, service, marketing, commerce, HR, and more. By harnessing the power of artificial intelligence to recognize patterns and relationships across your org’s data, it drives additional value out of the work you’re already doing in Salesforce. And now there are enough businesses and agencies on board that EPB delivers (numerically) more than 10 predictions per person, per day, for the entire global population!

And it’s not just EPB that’s taken off — [Einstein for Service’s](https://www.salesforce.com/products/service-cloud/automated-customer-service/) AI chat bots that guide customer support and help agents get straight to aiding customers, has seen a 300% increase in use since February of this year. Einstein for Sales has driven a 32% increase in converting prospects to buyers using Einstein Lead Scoring, and [IDC predicts](https://www.wsj.com/articles/world-wide-ai-spending-expected-to-double-in-next-four-years-11598520600?mod=djemAIPro) that global spending on AI will double in the next four years, so expect those numbers to keep climbing!

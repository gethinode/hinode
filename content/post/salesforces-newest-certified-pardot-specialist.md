Is me!
This blog isn’t often used for shameless bragging, but today’s an exception because I just earned my first (and MK Partners’ 77th) Salesforce Certification!
{{< image src="/img/1_KrT4g9Wi8rx28E_nHaoRnQ.jpg" title="Image" >}}

(Note: I’m not sure if the Credential ID is private, so I blurred it just to be safe).
As a regular user and admin of Pardot for marketing (and consulting) purposes, I wasn’t really stressed about the content because I live it, but the actual process of taking an online-proctored Salesforce exam was much more stressful than I’d anticipated.
But, despite some technical hiccups early on, all ended well and I’m proud to be Salesforce’s newest Certification earner (for the next few minutes at least).
If you’re planning on taking the cert yourself sometime soon, be sure to [brush up on the basics](https://youtu.be/ZqlY3RKtPDs), and [subscribe to the MK Partners’ YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXmSwyf8nsmpnSeOXD1JpPg) where I’ll keep the Pardot content coming until everyone’s comfortable using the platform!
Until next time, keep working hard, smart, and happy — and we’ll see you in the cloud.

The days are getting longer and so is our event list! Events big and small are happening this week, and there is something for everyone (except a Summer Solstice event, sorry ladies). So sit back, open up your calendar, and let’s get planning!

The week is starting out educational and honestly, I should probably attend this event. The Portland, OR Women in Tech group is hosting [Salesforce Certification: The Why, How, and Virtual Test Taking Tips](https://trailblazercommunitygroups.com/events/details/salesforce-salesforce-women-in-tech-group-portland-united-states-presents-salesforce-certification-the-why-how-and-virtual-test-taking-tips/) today, June 25th at 5pm (PDT). A Salesforce Developer will talk about Salesforce certifications, why they are important, how to prepare, and tips for taking it virtually! As someone who has taken a certification test once, I would recommend anyone who hasn’t taken a cert test yet or needs help, attend this session!

Then on Tuesday, June 22nd we have two events both occurring at 11am (PDT). The first, [What’s New in myTrailhead](https://www.salesforce.com/form/events/webinars/form-rss/3161778)?, will give viewers an exclusive look of the latest features coming to myTrailhead. They will also be doing a live demo and will answer any questions. As someone who uses Trailhead often, I can’t wait to see what the new features are!

Our second event, [Pardot Product Roadmap: Powering the Next Generation of B2B Marketing](https://www.salesforce.com/form/events/webinars/form-rss/3204745), will also give an exclusive look at the Pardot product roadmap for the rest of 2021. They will also talk about the evolution of B2B Marketing and where the future of marketing automation is headed. My coworker, Chris Stegall and myself, also may be in attendance at this event.

The event we all have been waiting for is finally here! [TrailheaDX](https://www.salesforce.com/trailheadx/) is back and will be completely virtual this year. On Wednesday, June 23rd starting at 8:45am (PDT) and going roughly until 3pm (PDT) TrailheaDX will inspire you when Salesforce talks about their newest innovations, products, demos, and speeches from the executives. An event for anyone in the ecosystem, Mindy Kaling will be your “spiritual guide” again this year, and Fitz and the Tantrums will wrap it up! There are also over a hundred watch parties occurring in the community groups, so check to see if your local group is hosting one! I’ve made [not one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcPxIDocayA), but [two Youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oULXTOc36SE) about this event already, so head to our channel to see what to expect of TrailheaDX and how to build your schedule! Also, you know Chris Stegall and I will have a review video about it afterwards, so keep an eye out for that video!

After TrailheaDX wraps up, head over to the [B2B Marketing/ Pardot User Group Virtual Happy Hour](https://trailblazercommunitygroups.com/events/details/salesforce-salesforce-marketer-group-pardot-san-francisco-united-states-presents-b2b-marketingpardot-user-group-virtual-happy-hour-2021-06-23/) hosted by the San Francisco, CA group! This event starts at 4pm (PDT) and they want to talk about everything marketing, and probably even the new marketing innovations mentioned during TrailheaDX. Make sure to RSVP if you are interested and bring all of your questions and friends!

If you can’t make it to the Happy Hour, but still want to attend a social hour event, then you are in luck! On Thursday, June 24th the San Diego, CA Nonprofit User group is hosting a [Salesforce Virtual Lunch](https://trailblazercommunitygroups.com/events/details/salesforce-salesforce-nonprofit-user-group-san-diego-united-states-presents-salesforce-virtual-lunch-meet-up/) meet up at 11am (PDT). This session will also be a casual chit chat hour and friends are welcome to attend as well!

Another event occurring on Thursday, June 24th… well I think is occurring… is [Texas Dreamin’](https://www.texasdreamin.org/)! Hopefully you know the drill about the Dreamin’ conferences, but if not, they are conferences meant to bring everything Salesforce to the locals! It’s a great way to network and learn more about Salesforce. This event is supposed to be scheduled on June 24th and 25th, however there seems to be some confusion about the dates and event type, so someone help us out! On their website they said they are not meeting up in-person, but according to Salesforce and Texas Dreamin’ Twitter page, it will be at the AT&T Executive Education Center on the 24th and 25th of June, but wait plot twist… their Twitter page ALSO gives us as July 8th and 9th as dates of the event. So someone please tweet us at MK Partners and let us know what’s going on!

Moving on from my confusion, our other Friday, June 25th event is occuring at 12pm (CDT). The Women in Tech group of Frisco, TX is hosting [Respecting Data Privacy Laws on Salesforce](https://trailblazercommunitygroups.com/events/details/salesforce-salesforce-women-in-tech-group-frisco-united-states-presents-respecting-data-privacy-laws-on-salesforce/), a topic everyone should be aware of! When you are designing customer solutions for clients, you need to know how to implement them and any requirements that might hinder you. Additionally, you have a chance to win a Salesforce voucher if you sign up, so why are you waiting?

We are ending the week on a Saturday for those of you who can’t attend an event during the week. The San Ramon, CA Admin group is hosting [Flow into Summer ’21 and TDX ’21 Quiz](https://trailblazercommunitygroups.com/events/details/salesforce-salesforce-admin-group-san-ramon-united-states-presents-flow-into-summer21-and-tdx-21-quiz/). The Summer ’21 release includes updates to flows and they will be teaching viewers these updates step by step with a technical architect. They will end the meeting with a TDX quiz, so make sure to tune in to TrailheaDX, because the prize is a voucher

## Recap

The Indianapolis, IN Women in Tech group started the week with _Reunited & it Feels so Good_! They had their first in-person meeting in over a year; what did you guys talk about? The Santa Barbara, CA Salesforce Admin group taught viewers how to create Apex-involved utilities for flows and processes in _Supercharge Processes and Flows with Invocable Apex_. The annual _Education Summit_ occurred with Michelle Obama as one of the speakers, did you enjoy it?

The _Success Anywhere World Tour_ kicked off to teach others how companies are using Customer 360 innovations to succeed. We had a chance to hear about the new features coming out this year, including additions to Interaction Studio, Einstein, Pardot and a few other platforms in _Marketing Cloud June 2021 New Feature Overview_.

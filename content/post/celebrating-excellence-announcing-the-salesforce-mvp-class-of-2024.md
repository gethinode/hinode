They’ve been called guides, beacons, mentors, tentpoles, cheerleaders, community leaders, and more — but nothing quite captures the breadth and depth of their unique expertise, passion, dedication, and contributions to the Salesforce community at large.
These Trailblazers inspire, educate, and empower others, driving positive change and elevating the community to new heights. And now, it’s time to celebrate their extraordinary contributions as we proudly announce the 2024 class of Salesforce MVPs!

## A Tradition of Excellence

For over a decade, the Salesforce MVP program has recognized and honored outstanding individuals who go above and beyond to share their knowledge, support their peers, and champion the Salesforce platform. These MVPs embody the spirit of Trailblazing, serving as beacons of inspiration and leadership within the community.

## The Moment We’ve Been Waiting For

Next week, on Feburary 27th, we invite you to join a [special LinkedIn livestream event](https://go.mkp.dev/MVPs2024) where the newest members of the Salesforce MVP team will be unveiled!
It promises to be an unforgettable celebration of excellence, collaboration, and innovation.

## What to Expect

During the livestream, you’ll have the opportunity to hear directly from some newly appointed MVPs as they share their personal journeys, insights, and visions for the future of the Salesforce ecosystem and Salesforce has also promised us, “a glimpse into the nomination process, and learn about what makes this recognition so special”.
From thought-provoking discussions to heartfelt testimonials, this event should offer a behind-the-scenes glimpse into the diverse talents, personalities, and passions of the MVP community.

## Why It Matters

The Salesforce MVP program is more than just a professional recognition — it’s a symbol of commitment, dedication, and impact. These MVPs represent some of the best and brightest minds in the Salesforce world, driving innovation, fostering collaboration, and inspiring others to reach their full potential. By celebrating their achievements, we honor the collective spirit of Trailblazers everywhere and reaffirm our commitment to building a stronger, more inclusive community.

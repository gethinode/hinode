If you’re looking to launch your Salesforce career or are eager to bag your first cert after a little bit of exposure to the platform — the Salesforce ‘Associate’ certifications are designed to be an excellent entry point to demonstrate your newfound skills.
Built for users or newer members of the Salesforce ecosystem, they offer an opportunity to illustrate mastery of the foundations of the platform or a specific feature or use-case (and it doesn’t hurt that they’re typically cheaper than the more advanced certs too: $75 instead of $200).

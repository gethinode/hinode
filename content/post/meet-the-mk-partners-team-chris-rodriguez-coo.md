We’re back with another installment of our interviews with the [MK Partners’ team](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxConsultingListingDetail?listingId=a0N30000001gF9jEAE)!
This time Caylin sat down (virtually) with our COO, Chris Rodriguez. They chat about his decade-plus experience at MK Partners and how he uses Salesforce daily for management, sales, operations, reporting, and even doing some admin and dev work (and more). Give it a [watch](https://youtu.be/_A5XX9JzGPU) below!

Between social distancing, stay at home orders, and our collective efforts to flatten the curve, for many of us, the horizons of our day-to-day worlds have shrunk to the size of our homes or apartments. In these unparalleled times, staying active and engaged, despite those physical limitations, is an important component of self-care. Whatever your “treatment” of choice, exercise, hobbies, puzzle-solving, baking, binge-watching, if you’re engaged by learning, more and more companies are offering free professional development courses so you can skill up, while you stay home.

In today’s post we’ll be talking about [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/), and their [announcement](https://www.tableau.com/learn/training/elearning) of 90 days of free eLearning for everyone. Let’s dive in!

What is Tableau
---------------

Googling “What is \[tech company\]” is an awesome exercise for buzzword bingo, but doesn’t always clarify things much, so let’s start with a high-level overview of what Tableau is and does.

In short, it’s a data visualization tool (it translates data into graphic representations, like charts, graphs, etc…) and it’s big claim to fame is its ability to basically grab your organizations’ data from anywhere (spreadsheets, software, databases, the cloud, etc…) and access it, analyze it, and compare it, all in one place. The goal being to help everyone in the organization more easily recognize relationships and trends between seemingly disparate info, and then plan, act, and react accordingly!

If you have a couple minutes, [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfE9jBq002s) breaks it down pretty well.

Needless to say, it’s a powerful piece of software in a space with ever-increasing demand from all types of organizations, which makes it prime candidate for professional development.

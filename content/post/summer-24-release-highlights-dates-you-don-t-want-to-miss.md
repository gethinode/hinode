Depending on where you are, the weather may not be showing it, but we’re well on the way to the Salesforce Summer ’24 Release!
As always, we’ll be peppering the countdown to “go live” with another round of our [Release Highlights](https://medium.com/tag/release-highlights) — collecting and collating the important dates and deadlines, perusing the release notes to gather the most exciting and important updates headed to orgs everywhere, and ensuring that you and your team can hit the ground running once Summer ’24 launches!
And now we know the dates admins and devs will want to keep their eyes on as we get closer to release day.
Let’s dive in!

## Pre-Release Org Sign-Up — April 18

Ina couple weeks, admins will be able to sign up for a [pre-release environment](https://www.salesforce.com/form/signup/prerelease-summer23/?_ga=2.55265259.1341205535.1681922652-1161755802.1667412373&_gl=1*1f139ea*_ga*MTE2MTc1NTgwMi4xNjY3NDEyMzcz*_ga_EE9XB9ZV8F*MTY4MjExMTg3NC4xMC4wLjE2ODIxMTE4NzQuMC4wLjA.), which is full of all the Summer ’24 features, free to explore to your heart’s content! And, if you have a previous instance of a pre-release org from the Spring ’24 release, you can save yourself the signup and [simply log back into that org](https://gs0.salesforce.com/?_ga=2.164653311.1341205535.1681922652-1161755802.1667412373) once the orgs go live! (Don’t worry, we won’t judge you for having to reset your password).

## Release Notes Go Live — April 24

April 24th will mark the big day! The day documentation goes up on all the new updates, upgrades, improvements, and more we’ll get to enjoy courtesy of Sumer ‘24! And as always, we’ll pore over the fine print looking for the features, updates, and upgrades that stand out to us as the most time-saving, meaningful, game-changing, and have the greatest potential to increase your platform ROI!
And our clients’!
And our own!

## Sandbox Previews Go Live — May 10

If you’ll be taking advantage of the sandbox preview, they’ll be going live in mid-May so you’ll be able to take all the new features for a test spin! Sandbox previews are our greatest source of accurately evaluating just how valuable individual updates are going to be to our org, and our clients’ orgs, so it’s definitely worth the time if you get the chance.

## Release Site Goes Live — May 10

Therelease notes are a great start, but what if you’re looking for a Trailhead module to walk you through the release in a clear, digestible, slightly-gamified way? Well the 10th also marks the launch of the release readiness website with short videos, helpful demos, and a whole module designed to impart the most knowledge with the least amount of friction, whatever your preferred learning style!

## Release Readiness LIVE Broadcast — May 29–31

The admin and developer evangelists are kicking off the Summer ’24 Release with another round of “Release Readiness Live”! Then, the product management team will discuss and demo the new features. We’ll get to see how those features work in real time and get a sneak peek into the roadmap for the rest of 2024!

## Summer ’24 Go Live

And finally, the main event! When can you expect Summer ’24 to be live in your production environment. It depends a bit on your org ID, but the release is being broken out into 3 main sweeps, a super-limited pilot program first, and then two much wider releases before it’s in orgs everywhere:
**May 17 — First Release Weekend (Limited, Pilot participation)**
**June 07—Second Release Weekend**
**June 14 — Final Release Weekend**

As always, we’ll be doing another round of [Release Highlights](https://medium.com/creme-de-la-crm/tagged/release-highlights) posts and videos as we countdown to launch, so stay tuned for our picks for favorite new features and, if you have any of your own, feel free to drop them in the comments.
Until then, keep working hard, smart, and happy. We’ll see you in the cloud.

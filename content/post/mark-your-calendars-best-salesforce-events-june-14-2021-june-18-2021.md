Summer is almossst here and I can smell the sunscreen and BBQs already! I don’t have any BBQ or Happy Hour events, but that doesn’t mean the calendar isn’t full. In fact, it’s one of the busiest weeks we’ve had in a while! So sit back, open up your calendar, and let’s get planning!

The Indianapolis, IN Women in Tech group is [Reunited & it Feels so Good](https://trailblazercommunitygroups.com/events/details/salesforce-salesforce-women-in-tech-group-indianapolis-united-states-presents-reunited-it-feels-so-good/) and they can’t wait for you to join them! They are having their first in-person meeting today, Tuesday, June 15th at 5:30pm (EDT) at a local park to accommodate social distancing preferences. They are asking you to bring a chair, snacks, and beverages, and masks are optional (but be aware of others preferences). They haven’t mentioned what they are going to talk about, but I figure it will be a catch up/ social meeting.

Flows and Apex are like peanut butter and jelly — they belong together. Flows are the future of the automation of the Salesforce platform and Apex can make that a lot easier. Luckily for you, the Santa Barbara, CA Salesforce Admin group is teaching you how to create Apex-involved utilities for flows and processes. In [Supercharge Processes and Flows with Invocable Apex](https://trailblazercommunitygroups.com/events/details/salesforce-salesforce-admin-group-santa-barbara-united-states-presents-supercharge-processes-and-flows-with-invocable-apex-1/) you’ll see examples of leveraging code “to establish the basic mechanics of creating an invocable Apex Action,” and more complicated multiple inputs. They will also demo Processes and share the code that provides multiple inputs to the Invocable Apex. Finally, they will “send you home” with some resources so that you can further your knowledge. This event is also on Tuesday, June 15th, but at 6pm (PDT) and is virtual.

We have 2 large Salesforce events of the week and the first one is their annual [Education Summit](https://www.salesforce.org/events/education-summit-2021/?_ga=2.246827078.312239876.1623108453-219845214.1586544338) on Wednesday, June 16th! Formally known as the Higher Ed Summit, this event is focused on Trailblazers in the education world, regardless if they are from a K-12 institution or a private college. Stories, knowledge and opportunities will be shared virtually during this event with over 35 sessions scheduled to bring this information to you. With the likes of Michelle Obama (\*insert high pitch sequel\*), Yuval Noah Harari, and Bryan Stevenson as speakers, and the University of Colorado as the co-host, this all day event is sure to deliver! This event begins at 7am (PT) but is broadcasted to Europe and Asia as well, so check out their website for your start time.

Maybe you aren’t in the education world, but the nonprofit one. Well I still have not one, but two events for you on Wednesday, June 16th! [All About Apps! Mini Demos of our Favorite Apps](https://trailblazercommunitygroups.com/events/details/salesforce-salesforce-nonprofit-user-group-st-louis-united-states-presents-all-about-apps-mini-demos-of-our-favorite-apps/) is being hosted by the St. Louis, MO Salesforce Nonprofit User group at 11am (CDT). As the title explains, the group is going to demo their favorite apps for nonprofits, and they want you to share yours too! They are also leaving time for a Q&A session, casual conversation, and to give away swag.

Our second nonprofit event is actually across the pond in the Netherlands. In [The Mystery Donor: How did Nonprofits in the Netherlands Perform in Secret Research on Online Giving](https://www.salesforce.com/nl/form/sfdo/ngo/the-mystery-donor-webinar/?_ga=2.236841283.312239876.1623108453-219845214.1586544338), the speakers will go over the research Salesforce secretly conducted from 630 companies across 9 countries by becoming a secret donor. They will go over their results and tactics that businesses can use for your donors’ experience. Additionally, they will go over 5 ways to improve the online giving experience and boost fundraising income. They even state that some of these methods can be implemented in 24 hours! Make sure to register if you are across the pond, or if you speak Dutch and happen to be interested in this event.

Our second big event of the week is on Thursday, June 17th starting at 9am (PT). The [Success Anywhere World Tour](https://www.salesforce.com/world-tour/june/home/) is kicking off again to teach others how companies are using Customer 360 innovations to succeed, well from anywhere in the world! The session will start with a 10 minute interview with a special Trailblazer, transition to a 40 minute discussion with a few special guests, including NBC Universal, and end with a 10 minute performance from a guest artist. Register for the event to stay tuned to all of the episodes that are coming out over the next few months.

If you aren’t curious about becoming successful anywhere, well I do have a [Marketing Cloud June 2021 New Feature Overview](https://www.salesforce.com/form/events/webinars/form-rss/3135688) also at 9am (PT). Yow will have a chance to hear about the new features coming out this year, including additions to Interaction Studio, Einstein, Pardot and a few other platforms. Consider this a sneak peak event more than an office hours.

We are ending the week with another in-person event (I’m so glad that we are transitioning back to in-person events)! The Bozeman, MT Salesforce Nonprofit user group is having an [In-person Nonprofit User Group Meeting](https://trailblazercommunitygroups.com/events/details/salesforce-salesforce-nonprofit-user-group-bozeman-united-states-presents-in-person-non-profit-user-group-meeting-june-17th-at-noon/) on June 17th, at 12pm (MDT). This will be hosted at a conference room in an office and will be providing lunch, so you MUST RSVP. This meeting will center around duplicate and matching rules, and may discuss other topics if time permits. Follow the link, as they included a Trailhead module if you are unfamiliar with the topic and want to brief yourself on it before joining the meeting.

## Recap

Last week, we started off the week with the Seattle, WA Salesforce Admin group for the Seattle Group Meeting which focused on certifications, learning pathways, and career development in the Salesforce ecosystem. Salesforce has its annual Industries Summit; which session did you like the most? The Lexington Salesforce Admin group had How to land your first job in the Salesforce ecosystem and then Grow with guest speaker, Austin Sherman.

The Bellingham Salesforce Nonprofit User group hosted Virtual Meeting: Rollups, Part 2 to show and teach viewers tools that can help you build rollups with little to no code and share resources to practice SOQL.

We talk a lot about new [Salesforce releases](https://medium.com/tag/release-highlights/archive) here. With three every year ([Winter](https://medium.com/creme-de-la-crm/winter-20-release-highlights-lightning-is-going-live-permanently-1f439d4103e8), [Spring](https://medium.com/creme-de-la-crm/spring-20-release-highlights-samesite-cookies-integrations-and-preparing-for-google-chrome-80-9955cb7e4a41), and [Summer](https://medium.com/creme-de-la-crm/summer-19-release-highlights-back-to-the-classics-7b9abe9e6cf9)) it feels like there’s always something “new and improved” right around the corner. And, while the [IdeaExchange](https://trailblazer.salesforce.com/ideaSearch) has long existed as an outlet for influence — where users’ suggestions can be shared with the Salesforce community at large and voted up or down based on shared demand, it’s sometimes felt underpowered in terms of immediate impact.

Sure, you could cast your vote, bookmark the idea to keep tabs on it, and hope every time you cracked open the newest release notes you’d find your dream addition somewhere on the list. But starting at the end of 2019, Salesforce began giving users even more say in the product and project roadmap — thanks to [prioritization voting](https://ideas.salesforce.com/s/prioritization)!

Now, ideas that have support on the IdeaExchange are mapped out with an estimated timetable by the product teams and then we, the users, get to vote on which to bump up or down the priority list! That means we now have the power to say, “Yes! Finally! But even faster, please — I need that!”

Voting is only open for two weeks at a time (consider it open enrollment for the roadmap) and we whipped up a short, [handy video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRE4EP0nwMI) to guide you through the process!

Now head over to the [IdeaExchange](https://ideas.salesforce.com/s/prioritization) and cast your own votes for the features, upgrades, and updates you’d most like to see in your org!

We’re right on the cusp of the [Spring ’20 release](https://releasenotes.docs.salesforce.com/en-us/spring20/release-notes/salesforce_release_notes.htm), so stay tuned here for more highlights of our favorite coming-soon features and, as always, if you have Salesforce questions, issues, or need help making your org work better for your business — [drop us a line](/contact)!

Until next time, keep working hard, smart, and happy! And we’ll see you in the cloud.

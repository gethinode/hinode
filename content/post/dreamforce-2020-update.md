What had been (a bit vaguely) presented as the 2020 incarnation of Dreamforce: [_Dreamforce to You_](https://www.salesforce.com/dreamforce/), taking place from November-December has gotten an update on dates, events, and opportunities to participate!

First up, while Dreamforce to You has technically kicked off with the opportunity to get personalized demos of Customer 360 from your AEs, the festivities as we've come to know them will really spin up with Marc Benioff's keynote on December 2nd (originally scheduled for tomorrow, 11/12)!

Two weeks after that, we'll have 4 back-to-back-to-back-to-back days of virtual events Salesforce has started calling "DreamTX" from December 14th to 17th! That's looking like it'll be the most "conventional" portion of 2020's adapted Dreamforce, so expect full session schedules and sign-ups in the coming weeks!

And, to stay in the loop as new news develops, be sure to [subscribe to our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/MkpartnersHQ/videos) where we'll be posting regular updates, Dreamforce prep content, and then daily previews and recaps once everything kicks off!

Until then, keep working hard, smart, and happy. We'll see you in the cloud.

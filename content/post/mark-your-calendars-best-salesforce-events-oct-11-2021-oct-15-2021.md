I have a short, but a mixed bag of events for you this week. Some are short, some are very long, and some aren’t even Salesforce events. Regardless, you are bound to learn something this week! So sit back, open up your calendars, and let’s get planning!

[Google Cloud Next ’21](https://cloud.withgoogle.com/next?utm_source=cloud_sfdc&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=FY21-Q4-global-ES903-onlineevent-er-next-2021&utm_content=next-reg-email-2-member_level_partners&utm_term=-&mkt_tok=ODA4LUdKVy0zMTQAAAF_ZR5JEa6WV3MWEG-YJ7-EYWVffY-DDqDqaH_O1l8ATl4rQ5uP6kDqq1VH-nLFlcjol9pExyiLki7hGJrnTpio6-6-5MqDG2GK_jCgnhm5nCOxW2_a6Q) conference is starting on Tuesday, October 12th to talk about what’s new and occurring in the Google cloud. Starting at 9am (PST), this three day event will start every morning with a keynote speech from industry leaders and then lead into their sessions. The sessions fall into eleven different themes, allowing you to customize your virtual conference experience! As a heads up, the first two days are only half days, but the third day starts early at 7am (PST) and ends at 7:30pm (PST), so be prepared for twelve hours of learning. It’s free to join, so make sure to register soon!

Also on Tuesday, October 12th we have one out of two Trailhead Live events occurring this week. We have another episode in the Skill Up on Slack series, with this week focusing on [Slack Etiquette and Productivity](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/live/broadcasts/a2r3k000001dKJ7/skill-up-on-slack--slack-etiquette-and-productivity) at 11:30am (PST). This 15 minute event (you really have no reason not to attend) will cover why etiquette and productivity are important to work effectively in Slack. The speaker will also share a few of their favorite top tips.

Then on Thursday, October 14th at 6am (PST) the UN Global Compact is hosting [How to Advance Women’s Leadership in Climate Action](https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_DDhmVcVJTmy79PtFCpVI4Q). According to the UN, “80% of people displaced by climate change are women” which is why we need to ensure climate justice and lasting solutions for women and include their voices in the conversation. During this session you will learn why women are disportionately affected, how to help advance women’s voices and leadership roles in STEM, and how you can overall support women-led climate solutions. This webinar will be translated to include five other languages beyond English.

Our second Trailhead Live event of the week is at 12pm (PST) on Tuesday, October 14th. [True to the Core: IdeaExchange](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/live/broadcasts/a2r3k000001dKLm/true-to-the-core-live-ideaexchange) is occurring so you can meet the team working on the reimagined IdeaExchange. You’ll get a chance to see the newest features coming out this month and maybe even what’s to come after this month… fingers crossed! There is also a live question and answer section and a chance for you to provide feedback about the new IdeaExchange.

## Recap

Last week Salesforce was joined by Emerald, to talk about key marketing takeaways from this year so that you can start planning for 2022 in _5 B2B Marketing Takeaways to Inform Your 2022 Marketing Plans_. Then in _Gathering Feedback through Mobile Devices_ Salesforce talked about gathering feedback and improving the customer experience on mobile devices that dropped in the Winter ’22 Release. We kicked off the _Skill Up on Slack: Slack Basics_ to help new users get started with Slack not only get set up, but some general best practices.

We heard about _Security in the Age of Work from Anywhere_ where experts from Salesforce’s Healthcare and Life Science department talked about solutions in the government, security, and compliance sectors due to their employees now getting to work from anywhere in the world. Finally, newbies in the Salesforce ecosystem got a chance to really get their foot in the door in the _[Trailblazer Connect Career Fair: Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and Poland](_!

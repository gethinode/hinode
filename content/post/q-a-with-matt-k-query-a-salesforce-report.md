We’re back with another [Q &amp; A with Matt K](https://medium.com/tag/q-and-a-with-matt-k), our weekly series where Matt sits down to tackle Salesforce questions from the community — unrehearsed and unedited to demonstrate what it looks like when we encounter, evaluate, troubleshoot, and resolve real-world issues and use-cases!
And today’s question comes from the Trailblazer Community! In the #Customer Service group, a Trailblazer asked if it’s possible (and how to) query and extract a report from Salesforce for use in a third-party system or platform. They shared name of their report, and Matt walks us through formulating the code and solution with Apex!

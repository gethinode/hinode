No, it’s not a new branch of the military to combat excitement — it’s a re-architecture of Salesforce! [Hyperforce](https://www.salesforce.com/news/press-releases/2020/12/02/introducing-salesforce-hyperforce/) was designed to deliver a more-powerful and more-scalable platform especially for governments and global clients dealing with stricter requirements around data management and storage.

## Choose Where Your Data Resides

While Salesforce bills this as “storing your data locally”, they’re not making a move to on-prem platform implementation, but rather allowing organizations to select the geographic location of their public cloud servers so they can remain in compliance with whatever regulations affect them. That phrasing is probably bound to create a little confusion between those who think of “local” geographically versus those who think of “local” from a systems’ perspective, but it’s a change that will allow a lot more international and public-sector clients to roll out Salesforce without having to get regulations changed.

## Improved Scalability and Flexibility

One of the upsides to Hyperforce will be the increased ease-of-access to additional computing capacity as-needed in the public cloud. Resource elasticity will be driven by clients’ use and their org’s needs, and additional resources will be able to be deployed quickly, so Salesforce orgs will always be ready to scale with their clients.

## Security

While not a change, per se, Salesforce is an industry-leader in trust and security, and those traits are baked into this re-architecture to ensure that users’ data is always safe. Alongside geographic requirements for data, security requirements are some of the most common hurdles public-sector agencies and international organizations have to navigate in purchasing, so ensuring security was still best-in-class was a day 1 requirement of Hyperforce.

## And It’s Backward Compatible

We’d all hoped, and Salesforce has confirmed — the shift to Hyperforce won’t hurt your existing apps, customizations, configurations, or integrations. Phew :).
If you have any questions about how the change will affect your org, would like to learn more about Hyperforce to see if it helps you get past a previous purchasing hurdle, or just need a hand getting your existing org in-line with your current business processes — [drop us a line](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxConsultingListingDetail?listingId=a0N30000001gF9jEAE)!

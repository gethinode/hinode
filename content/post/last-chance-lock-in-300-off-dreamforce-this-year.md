Tomorrow’s the day that Dreamforce ’24 ticket sales kick off — but if you [act fast](https://www.salesforce.com/form/dreamforce/df24-save-the-date/) (like, in the next 8 hours fast), you can lock in what Salesforce is calling “best Dreamforce deal, ever”!

This year’s event is headed to San Francisco September 17th — 19th and, while tickets go on sale tomorrow, June 11, if you get yourself on the [early bird list](https://www.salesforce.com/form/dreamforce/df24-save-the-date/) before the clock strikes midnight you’ll have until June 28th to register at the 20% off the, already reduced, early bird prices!
Compared to the “last chance” pricing it’s a savings of over $1200!
So what are you waiting for! Get yourself on the list today, and you have three weeks to try to sort out the rest of your DF ‘24!

Of course, as we get closer and closer to the big week, we’ll be doing our regular round up of speakers, sessions, extra-curricular events, networking opportunities, free stuff digests, and more!
So be sure to subscribe here, stick around, and, until then, keep working hard, smart, and happy.
And we’ll see you in the cloud!

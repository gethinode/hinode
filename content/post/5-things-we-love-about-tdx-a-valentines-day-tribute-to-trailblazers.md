[TrailblazerDX ](https://www.salesforce.com/trailblazerdx)is less than a month away and, as Trailblazers around the world gear up for the annual Salesforce developer conference, we find ourselves looking forward to another amazing gathering and reflecting on the incredible TDX experiences we’ve shared over the years.
And what better day than Valentine’s Day to run through the things we love most about TDX! As hearts, and candies, and candy hearts, and hearty candies take over the timelines — here’s our top 5 things we love about TDX!

## Community, Camaraderie, and Connection

TDX isn’t just a conference — like Dreamforce, it’s a gathering of Trailblazers from around the globe, united in their shared experiences with the platform, and their desires to do and make great things.

In fact, what began as a developer conference has grown it’s audience over the years with the rapid gains Salesforce has made with low and no code tools. In fact, where the ‘D’ in ‘[TDX](https://www.salesforce.com/trailblazerdx)’ at one point stood for ‘Developer’, in recent years it’s been presented as both ‘[TrailblazerDX](https://www.salesforce.com/trailblazerdx)’ and ‘[TrailheadDX](https://www.salesforce.com/trailblazerdx)’ as the scope and invite list has expanded.
So now, whether you’re a seasoned developer, an aspiring admin, or a business leader embracing digital transformation, TDX brings us all together in a shared celebration of innovation and learning. The sense of camaraderie and support within the Salesforce community is truly heartwarming and consistently one of the best things about these events.

## Product Announcements and Insights

Every year TDX plays host to the reveal of some new exciting features and products for the platform. Last year we saw [EinsteinGPT ](https://www.salesforce.com/news/press-releases/2023/03/07/einstein-generative-ai/)take the stage, the introduction of a new Mascot (Flo the flying squirrel) — along with some improvements to Flow itself, Trailhead upgrades, and more!

Every year we’re eager to see what Salesforce is excited to show off and love the chance to take the good news back home to our colleagues and clients!

## Inspirational Keynotes

One of the highlights of TDX is the lineup of inspirational, compelling, and exciting keynotes delivered by industry leaders, Salesforce executives, and visionary Trailblazers. Oh yeah, and usually a celebrity sighting or two.

These thought-provoking sessions always serve to ignite our passion for technology, help calibrate our efforts and visions moving forward, and also inspire us to dream big and get developing on the platform. This year we’re still waiting on some additional speaker news, but we know we’ll end up loving the lineup once it’s locked!

## Helpful Community Sessions

TDX offers a diverse array of sessions covering the everything from deep-dive technical how-to’s, insights into the latest trends, best practices, innovative solutions, and even fun community workshops to help build the connections that make the platform and its user-groups so rewarding! And we’re no stranger to speaking ourselves, returning this year with 3 sessions on [Slack](https://reg.salesforce.com/flow/plus/tdx24/sessioncatalog/page/Catalog?_ga=2.49532582.1685950131.1707777742-1627426254.1707170226&search=rodriguez), [Tableau](https://reg.salesforce.com/flow/plus/tdx24/sessioncatalog/page/Catalog?_ga=2.49532582.1685950131.1707777742-1627426254.1707170226&search=stegall), and [AI chatbots](https://reg.salesforce.com/flow/plus/tdx24/sessioncatalog/page/Catalog?_ga=2.49532582.1685950131.1707777742-1627426254.1707170226&search=kaufman)!

We love these, typically user-led, sessions because they empower us to expand our skills, deepen our knowledge, and stay ahead of the curve (a challenge in the ever-evolving tech space).

## Unforgettable Experiences

Last but certainly not least, TDX is an experience like no other. From the electrifying energy of the Expo Floor to the lively discussions in breakout sessions and the unforgettable networking opportunities, TDX is a whirlwind of excitement, learning, and inspiration. The memories we create and the connections we forge at TDX are cherished long after the conference has ended. Don’t forget to stay tuned here as we get closer because we’ll collect and collate all the best off-campus events headed for TDX too (think happy hours, breakfasts, tourist walks, etc…) — because sometimes those outside-the-conf gatherings are what you’ll end up loving most about your time at TDX.

As we countdown to this year’s TDX, we’re filled with gratitude for the incredible experiences, opportunities, and connections that this conference brings into our lives every year.
So here’s to [TDX ](https://www.salesforce.com/trailblazerdx)— a beacon of innovation, inspiration, and community — an event with a lot to love. Happy Valentine’s Day, Trailblazers!
We’ll see you in the cloud.

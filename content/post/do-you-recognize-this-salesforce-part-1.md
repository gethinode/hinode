…and so has its homepage! The 3 annual releases aren’t the only updates Salesforce has had over the years. Over the years, product releases, acquisitions, UX overhauls, the invention of the iPhone, and more have all caused big changes to [www.salesforce.com.](http://www.salesforce.com.) We figured it’d be fun to look back at what used to be. And, thanks to the internet archive, we can!
Let’s dive in!

## 1999

{{< image src="/img/1_Ccf11OHOMcCRkjrzC5JvPQ.png" title="Image" >}}

November 28, 1999 — a world gripped in fear that in less than 35 days all the computers would… break. But Salesforce was officially underway! We’ve got a login portal, a free pilot program, and, at the very top, some familiar object tabs!
{{< image src="/img/1_qUZvq9OB4e_LibPtwfvpTQ.png" title="Image" >}}

There’s actually something almost wholesome about seeing these familiar little faces nearly 25 years ago.

## 2000

{{< image src="/img/1_4jE1Zd65005MHDN_CiuwYw.png" title="Image" >}}

By October of 2000 we’ve got a bit of a color overhaul with the dark green, some navigation tabs that are more about Salesforce as a product (as opposed to in-org UX), and a SaaSy sighting! (along with the 1–800-NO-SOFTWARE phone number).
{{< image src="/img/1_DbXRlc7yrUiGPU19Z0Rd4A.png" title="Image" >}}

How could anybody have doubted the power of SaaS?

## 2001

{{< image src="/img/1_Fbn75dOXXkk0OCWQnnIvIA.png" title="Image" >}}

By 2001 our greens have become blue, Salesforce is the “global leader”, there’s a 30-day test drive offer, and our page has been centered (although it’s not responsive — just narrow)!
Also, the login panel is also no longer housed on the main homepage and things are starting to look a little mor sleek and minimal. Goodbye 90’s internet.

## 2002

{{< image src="/img/1_nubLxTli27JrXLyX0xrF1A.png" title="Image" >}}

By 2002 we’ve got flags, a global presence, a free trial, free demos, and our first homepage callouts for “automation”!
{{< image src="/img/1_E5iN3UmbFnZt_WLoeK_cxQ.png" title="Image" >}}

I’m sure a few people are wondering how many users you got for $65 per month in 2002, but I’ll bet <strong>a lot</strong> of people are curious about Salesforce Offline Edition 👀👀👀. It feels like such a contradiction product-wise by today’s standards.

## 2004

{{< image src="/img/1_aBLk2WkyAckka6EKuo7mbg.png" title="Image" >}}

By 2004 we’ve got our first (now failed) Flash elements on the page! We’ve also got free whitepapers, webinars, and a confirmation that $65 is per person (they weren’t called “users” by sales yet) per month.
{{< image src="/img/1__alj_bjgh7LSjTCR5z__OA.png" title="Image" >}}

Also, the page has finally become loooooonger and the scroll bar has started to get some use.
{{< image src="/img/1_Amfq1gzGPkGRpaF3vTqbxA.png" title="Image" >}}

And here’s our first mention of Salesforce’s philanthropic efforts, the salesforce.com foundation, and a perhaps first-ever pledge 1% completion!

## 2005

{{< image src="/img/1_hYtDMfmWDPdUCmjfXrxQig.png" title="Image" >}}

By mid-2005, the homepage hasn’t changed much (although we can’t see what would have been in the Flash elements there, which probably saw fairly regular updates). But we can see that Salesforce is hiring!
{{< image src="/img/1_Cue_7bkyAPUYSalQiHpktg.png" title="Image" >}}

{{< image src="/img/1_CZEvWVaqheWj6qm8Slt0hQ.png" title="Image" >}}

2005 also marked a suffix-ification at Salesforce with homepage real estate for salesforce, supportforce, customforce, sforce, and multiforce! A precursor to the current “— Cloud” product suffixes, “force” was better for brand recognition and that was higher priority at the time.

A blurb I think I’ll start sending to relatives who ask what exactly I do nowadays.

## 2010

{{< image src="/img/1_46jVp2Wf6Uyb6ES3vul_vA.png" title="Image" >}}

{{< image src="/img/1_gi_p_K9LRNjiHUIxBlOD8A.png" title="Image" >}}

We’ve got cloud! The familiar asymmetric cloud that’s said “Salesforce” for the last 15 years has officially made an appearance by 2010!
{{< image src="/img/1_JLmHd7QQcWuZ9MAJMcWIwQ.png" title="Image" >}}

And it’s already being put to use linking the Salesforce brand with its big name clients (like 2010 Starbucks!) thanks to some graphic design/branding we still see the platform employ today!
{{< image src="/img/1_C13j51asLSnoZBJDut0ryQ.png" title="Image" >}}

2010’s site also celebrates the launch of Chatter!
{{< image src="/img/1_g9NcFSHHuqwWuU90eKwKOA.png" title="Image" >}}

And in a move that, in hindsight, kind of perfectly encapsulates the energy of 2010 and the sequel-heavy-box-office-summer we have callouts for Sales Cloud 2 and Service Cloud 2! (Rejected titles included: **Sales Cloud 2: Sell Harder **and **2 Service 2 Cloud).**

And with that we also get the more formal rollout of Customer Success Stories and a public-facing presentation of account size and industry-specific marketing!
{{< image src="/img/1_05hNf7q9BQtGUsGO3C324A.png" title="Image" >}}

A strategy that would prove succesful and remains in place to this day!

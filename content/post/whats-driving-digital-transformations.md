With the pandemic pushing so many workplaces remote, the rise of the Digital HQ, and an ever-expanding landscape of integratabtle business platforms — this isn’t the first time you’re hearing about Digital Transformation (DX, for short). But, are those the causes of the recent efforts by organizations everywhere to modernize, streamline, and digitize their processes, or is DX the inevitable conclusion of businesses’ strategic efforts to improve and align every aspect of their operations?

Well, now we have our answer, [straight from the source(s)](https://go.logigear.com/Infographic_Whats_Driving_DX)!

Salesforce is no stranger to digital transformation, in fact pursuit of “Customer 360” and “Digital 360” likely represent the first serious foray into DX for a lot of organizations. After all, Salesforce has always sought to deliver a “single source of truth” across all segments of an org, which is why it’s being embraced more and more as the go-to platform for these efforts.

And, when examining the common causes for, and challenges to, DX efforts in the surveys above, we can see a clear line between what Salesforce has been building to for years, and where organizations envision themselves ending up.

From tools to drive adoption, ease integrations, and empower every division, segment, and user with the full power of the platform — it’s no surprise that we’ve seen a dramatic uptick in interest lately from businesses no longer seeking small, department-specific projects, but full-org overhauls. Bringing everyone from sales and success to HR and finance together on one platform, automating out duplicated or manual efforts, and embracing the full potential of that consolidated data and insight, one thing is clear — if your organization isn’t making an effort to bring everything together virtually, you’re going to start finding yourself left behind.

Luckily, if you’re already running some processes out of Salesforce, then adding in additional departments, processes, and users is easier, and will allow you to more rapidly realize increased ROI from the platform.

And, of course, if you need a hand integrating any of your current core systems, spinning up a virtual version of the physical processes that you already know work, or just want some strategic, best-practice insight into how similar organizations are pursuing their DX objectives, [drop us a line](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxConsultingListingDetail?listingId=a0N30000001gF9jEAE) — we’re always happy to help.

Until next time, keep working hard, smart, and happy. And we’ll see you in the cloud.

Connecting with fellow Trailblazers during Salesforce and Community events brings joy and excitement to everyone. But what about the times in between? How do you find new ways to meet individuals with similar interests?

By joining a Trailblazer Community Group you have a chance to meet and collaborate with Trailblazers, based on location, role, and interests!
Let’s get started.

## Find A Meeting Near You

Start by heading over to the [Trailblazer Community Group](https://trailblazercommunitygroups.com/) site and search for meetings based on city or topic. Make sure to log in using your Trailhead account to be able to register if anything catches your attention. From the latest and greatest AI topics to more traditional roles and interests there is always a meeting type for everyone. These groups cater to both in-person and virtual sync. So, pick one and dive into the details.

## RSVP For A Meeting

Now that you’ve found something local to meet in person or jump on a virtual call — make sure to RSVP. This will notify the Group you are interested and provide a confirmation or QR code for you to use at the meeting. These meetings are usually free to attend and may include some food, snacks, beverages and giveaways to welcome the new gathering.

There is usually a cut-off date to confirm so make sure to look at the details in case you find one but forget to click on the RSVP button.

## Attend and Network

Now put on your comfy shoes and get ready to mingle as people near or far come together to meet once more. Some Trailblazers are regulars while others may come from time to time. As you begin to connect with individuals of similar interests, you’ll find way to connect outside these meeting and build personal relationships. Stay connected through communication channels, like Slack, and find new adventures to enjoy together.

On the virtual hand, even if you are not physically present you can still put a name to a face and find common interests. This will spark consideration to meet in-person the next time around.

No matter the case finding new ways to connect outside of events is great for anyone looking to network with others. Let us know how you connect and network with others.

And until next time, keep working hard, smart, and happy! And we’ll see you in the cloud.

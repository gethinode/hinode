Valentine’s Day is all about sharing love, spreading joy, and showing how much you care about those closest to you. And there’s hardly a better way to flex your affection than to spend the day helping your local community! That’s why we spent cupid’s favorite holiday with one of our favorite local resources: SOVA!

{{< image src="/img/mkp-at-sova-entrance.webp" title="MKP at entrance to SOVA" >}}

SOVA, which is so much more than a food pantry, provides free groceries and a slew of supportive services to the LA community each month! Our relationship with SOVA goes way back and they’re one of our favorite nonprofits to support with our [Pledge 1%](https://pledge1percent.org/) commitment.

This time around we were again, bagging, boxing, packing, and pallet-ing a week’s worth of groceries for our local friends in need. All told, we spent 3 hours at SOVA and prepped 7 pallets worth of goods! At 64 boxes per pallet, that’s a week of groceries for over 425 families!

At this point (and with SOVA’s help) we’ve almost gotten our assembly line down to a science and, despite the hard work involved, there’s always a smile on everyone’s face.

And this time some of us had the pleasure of partaking in some behind-the-scenes fun, helping the regular volunteer staff measure, portion, and pack servings of rice, oats, and grains for next week’s pallet-packing-fest!

All in all, it was another tremendous success and we consider ourselves so lucky to have an accessible, welcoming resource like SOVA in our community.

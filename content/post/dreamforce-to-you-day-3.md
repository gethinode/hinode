Day 3 of [Dreamforce to You](https://www.salesforce.com/dreamforce/) is upon us, and it's my favorite day of the event: Customer Success! With a ton of sessions to choose from, there's something for every org, role, and use case and we'll hear straight from users how Salesforce has helped transform their businesses, processes, and helped drive innovation!

And today's main event features Nobel Laureate Malala Yousafzai, Co-Founder of Malala Fund --- so a little bit different from Snoop Dogg and Martha Stewart yesterday, but should be an eye-opening discussion on activism, equality, and empowering education.

Tomorrow's the last and final day of this year's incarnation of [Dreamforce](https://www.salesforce.com/dreamforce/), so be sure to pick your sessions, tune in, and celebrate another year of improvement in Salesforce!

We'll see you in the cloud.

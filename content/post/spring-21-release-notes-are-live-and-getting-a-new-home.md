Not to jump straight past the year-end festivities, but if you're already practicing writing your "2021"s, then you know there's a lot in store next year in the world of Salesforce, like the Spring '21 Release!

And, while March may feel like a long ways away right now, sandbox previews are arriving [as early as January](https://www.salesforce.com/blog/spring-21-sandbox-preview/?bc=DB), and we've already got [release notes](https://releasenotes.docs.salesforce.com/en-us/spring21/release-notes/salesforce_release_notes.htm?edition=&impact=) and some news about this Spring's update!

{{< image src="/img/release-notes-moving-warning.png" >}}

First, [release notes are live](https://releasenotes.docs.salesforce.com/en-us/spring21/release-notes/salesforce_release_notes.htm?edition=&impact=)! I expect these to get built out a bit more as we get closer to release day and the Salesforce development roadmap for 2021 takes a bit more shape, but for now we get some insight into what will definitely make the cut, and what we'll have to prep our orgs for come Spring. From general enhancements, to even more functionality in Salesforce surveys, there are some exciting things on the horizon and, as always, we'll be sure to put together some posts around what new features and functionality we're most excited about!

Second, a bit of housekeeping --- or house moving, as it were. Salesforce release notes will be heading to a new home, [Salesforce Help](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=release-notes.salesforce_release_notes.htm&type=5&release=230)! The notes for Spring '21 are [already live there](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=release-notes.salesforce_release_notes.htm&type=5&release=230), so you can get a feel for the new layout, formatting, etc... --- but can still rely on the old site until July of next year in case you don't have the time to get reacclimatized yet.

It's not a huge change in terms of styling, no change in terms of content, so the only thing likely to be affected is all those old links in blogs, training decks, Trailheads, etc... --- time to get scraping and updating!

As always, if you have any questions about specifics in the Spring '21 Release, want a more personalized look at how changes might affect your org, or just need help getting your org's processes to match your business' --- [drop us a line](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxConsultingListingDetail?listingId=a0N30000001gF9jEAE)! We're always happy to help.

Until next time, keep working hard, smart, and happy. We'll see you in the cloud.

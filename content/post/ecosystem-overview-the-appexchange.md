It also provides an opportunity for organizations to turn their CRM efforts into revenue generators themselves, by packaging, publishing, and distributing their own apps, configurations, and offerings! And lastly, it provides access to a world of [experienced partners](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/consulting) and service-providers to help augment orgs’ efforts or build and configure the platform to perfectly meet their needs!
In short, one of the central hubs around which the rest of the Salesforce eco-system pivots.
In [this week’s video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvCtKwajELs), Matt and Chris walk through a high-level overview of the types of tools, offerings, and services that can be found on the [AppExchange ](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/)to boost your Salesforce org’s capabilities, how to navigate the marketplace effectively, and what to watch out for when making your selection.
Next they talk through how to get your own products listed on the AppExchange, considerations to make in terms of effective AppX branding, and what they’ve learned from their experiences as AppExchange publishers, both on the app/product and the consulting side!
They even review some existing listings and showcase opportunities for improvement!
[Give the video a watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvCtKwajELs) and then comment below an app you’d like to see listed on the marketplace! Maybe we’ll add it to our Built in Salesforce series and you’ll be able to install it in your org soon!
Of course, if you think you have an idea for an app that you could build a business around, or turn into a revenue generator for your org, but you need a hand getting it built — drop us a line! We’d be happy to help get you up, and running (and selling) on the AppExhange!
Until next time, keep working hard, smart, and happy!
And we’ll see you in the cloud.

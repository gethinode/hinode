Summer is in full swing and I’m already melting awayyyy. Hopefully the events this week can give me life, because honestly I don’t know what I’m going to do in this heat.

I do have some semi-disappointing news for those of us who like to attend the community group events. As I mentioned last week, community group events have changed their look and also how you can find which groups are hosting upcoming events. Well unfortunately Salesforce stole the carpet right out under me and now, unless you are part of that group, you can’t see if they are having an event. I guess it makes sense, because so many events are becoming in-person again, but I’m still going to miss seeing all of those virtual happy hours and events geared towards a very specific topic. As a result, my blog posts will be a bit smaller now and so will your calendars. But don’t worry I still have events for this week, so sit back, open up your calendars and let’s get planning!

Due to the fourth of July here in the United States, we don’t have any Monday events and the rest of the events taking place this week occur on Thursday, July 8th so keep reading to find out which event is for you!

The one I’m most excited about is the first ever [Consulting Dreamin’](https://www.salesforce.com/form/events/webinars/form-rss/3262053) taking place virtually in the UK and streaming to the US as well! Starting at 10am (BST and EST), this free all day event is geared towards consulting partners, or those interested in becoming a consulting partner, and is jam-packed with sessions! The sessions will cover topics such as understanding the role, the day-to-day job and its importance, and tips and advice from experts about the career. The sessions are broken up into keynotes, skills, experiences, careers, solutions, trailblazers, and ends the day with a demo jam. Some of these sessions will be prerecorded and others will be live for you to ask questions, so make sure to register!

With the announcement that Amazon Web Services is partnering up with Salesforce in TrailheaDX, we are of course going to have an event with them. Starting at 9am (PT) [AWS and Salesforce: Managing Date Across Your Organization](https://www.salesforce.com/form/events/webinars/form-rss/3262053) will target those in the nonprofit and education sectors to help them solve complex data management problems. This new partnership will allow for data to be more centralized and allow for innovation to increase and accelerate! Multiple guest speakers will be in attendance to deliver data strategies that will help transform your business data strategies!

Finally, and also taking place at 9am (PT) , Salesforce is hosting [Automating Feedback and Transforming Customer Experience](https://www.salesforce.com/form/events/webinars/form-rss/3262053). As the title says, this conversation is to highlight the automation of collecting feedback across customer journeys and how to analyze that information to help improve customer experience. You will also learn how to analyze trends and opportunities, and action feedback so that costumes feel heard.

## Recap

We don’t have a recap from last week, as all I talked about was TrailheaDX and how that went. Tweet us [@mkpartners](http://www.twitter.com/mkpartners) and let us know how TrailheaDX went for you!

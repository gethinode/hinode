Ready to start producing professional-quality documents, straight from your Salesforce org, but you're not sure where to start? We built [Mambo Merge](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxListingDetail?listingId=a0N3u00000MBinOEAT) to make it easy, and we made this video to make getting it up and running even easier!

Dreamforce 2021 is officially “Dreamforce Everywhere” and that means multiple cities around the world, in-person and online events, and more as we slowly begin the transition back to pre-covid-style professional events!

Shortened down to three days this year, September 21st — 23rd, speakers and sponsors will once again be returning to San Francisco, but will also be popping up in Europe and around the globe!

Chris and Caylin sat down to review the most recent announcements , frequently asked questions, and what to expect as this year’s biggest Salesforce event approaches!

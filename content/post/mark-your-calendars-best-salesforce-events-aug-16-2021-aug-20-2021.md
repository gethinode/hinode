Summer is almost over and I’m just sitting here like whatttt, we just got started! Has anyone been to any in-person Salesforce related events yet? I’m curious to see how they went, so tweet us @mkpartners to let me know! Okay let’s get into this week, so sit back, open up your calendars and get planning!

We are starting the week off with success, that is [Success from Anywhere: Your Digital HQ](https://www.salesforce.com/events-master/digital-hq/) to celebrate Slack officially joining Salesforce! (The buildup to this has been insane!) On Tuesday, August 17th at 10am (PST) we’ll hear how Salesforce and Slack “are coming together to create your digital HQ for success from anywhere.” Leaders from both Salesforce and Slack will be teaching how teams can utilize the new Slack-First Customer 360, which increases productivity and collaboration, and connects customer experiences. More information to come on the Salesforce Partner Community and you need to register to attend this event.

We have another event focusing on the Sustainable Development Goals, so Salesforce Partners listen up! [From Sourcing Practices to Legal Agreements: How to Drive Sustainability into Your Supply Chain](https://www.salesforce.com/form/events/webinars/form-rss/3313568), is focusing on data-driven climate action and how we can all achieve this on a scale that causes a positive impact. This will teach you not only how to stay on track with Salesforce’s Sustainability Exhibit, but also the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (remember we get points for this). Additionally, it will teach legal, sourcing, and procurement teams to work together to advocate for sustainability in the company. This event is on Wednesday, August 18th at 11am (PST).

Also on Wednesday, August 18th we have a unique Salesforce webinar focusing on homelessness. At 1pm (PST) viewers will learn how they and companies can help the homeless crisis that has become exacerbated by COVID-19 in [Homelessness: How Can You Help](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/live/broadcasts/a2r3k000001vDQ0/homelessness-how-can-your-company-help)? This Trailhead Live episode will shed light on the misunderstood and complex issue, and how government and nonprofits work together to solve this challenge. As someone who, once upon a time, worked for a company that focused on this issue, I highly recommend everyone attend to learn more not only how you can help, but what actually helps and what doesn’t.

Our last event is a recurring event on Thursday, August 19th at 9am (PST). The [Marketing Cloud August 2021 New Feature Overview](https://www.salesforce.com/form/events/webinars/form-rss/3258298) has product experts talk about the new features and additions to products such as Einstein, Pardot, Interaction Studio and many more! Definitely a meeting worth your time if you are in marketing, an Admin, or in sales.

## Recap

Marketers had a chance to learn _The Top 5 Real-Time Personalization Trends in 2021_ to help them with strategies and insights they could bring back to their company and help their marketing teams succeed! Newbees to the Salesforce ecosystem got to learn more about CRM in _What is Customer Relationship Management_? Lastly, those in the education sector learned how they can spend federal funding to support their students in _How Higher Ed Can Drive Student Success with ARP Funding_.

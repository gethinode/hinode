TrailblazerDX is behind us, Midwest Dreamin’ is on the horizon, and the steadily rising temps on the thermometer all point to one thing — the Salesforce Summer ’22 release is on the way! As always, we’ll be peppering the lead-up to launch with another round of [Release Highlights](https://medium.com/creme-de-la-crm/tagged/release-highlights) posts to show-off our picks for the most-anticipated updates, upgrades, and new features, and today we’ll be talking through the timeline so you can be sure to not miss a thing in this release cycle.

Let’s dive in!

### Sandbox Previews Go Live — May 6 + 7

If you’re taking advantage of the sandbox preview, they’re live so you can take all the new features for a test spin! Sandbox previews are our greatest source of accurately evaluating just how valuable individual updates are going to be to our org, and our clients’ orgs, so it’s definitely worth the time if you get the chance.

### Release Site Goes Live — May 6

The [release notes are already live](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.salesforce_release_notes.htm&type=5&release=238), but what if you’re looking for a [Trailhead module](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/content/learn/modules/summer-22-release-highlights/) to walk you through the release in a clear, digestible, slightly-gamified way? Well last week also marked the [launch of the release readiness website](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/content/learn/modules/summer-22-release-highlights/) with short videos, helpful demos, and a whole module designed to impart the most knowledge with the least amount of friction, whatever your preferred learning style!

### Release Readiness LIVE Broadcast— May 20–27

The admin and developer evangelists are kicking off the Summer ’22 Release with a broadcast to mention their favorite features! Then, the product management team will discuss and demo the new features. We’ll get to see how those features work in real time and get a sneak peek into the roadmap for the rest of 2022! Full details on the agenda and schedule will be posted in May on the [Release Readiness Trailblazers group](https://success.salesforce.com/featuredGroupDetail?id=a1z30000006IDYhAAO).

### Summer ’22 Go Live

And finally, the main event! When can you expect Summer ’22 to be live in your production environment. It depends a bit on your org ID, but the release is being broken out into 3 main sweeps, a super-limited pilot program first, and then two much wider releases before it’s in orgs everywhere:

- May 20 — First Release Weekend (Limited, Pilot participation)
- June 3 — Second Release Weekend
- June 10–11 — Final Release Weekend

Be sure to review [our guide](https://medium.com/creme-de-la-crm/how-to-check-when-the-spring-21-release-is-hitting-your-org-5167b887c1b6) on how to check exactly when you can expect the update on your end and, as always, the complete list of orgs, updates, and timelines is available on the [Salesforce Trust page](https://www.salesforce.com/blog/winter-22-sandbox-preview/#:~:text=gets%20upgraded.%20Our-,Trust,-page%20has%20the)!

As always, we’ll be doing another round of [Release Highlights](https://medium.com/creme-de-la-crm/tagged/release-highlights) posts and videos as we countdown to launch, so stay tuned for our picks for favorite new features and, if you have any of your own, feel free to drop them in the comments.

Until then, keep working hard, smart, and happy. We’ll see you in the cloud.

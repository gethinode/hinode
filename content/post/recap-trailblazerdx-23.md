Despite the chilly weather and cool breeze in the streets of San Francisco, around 5000 Trailblazers from across the globe gathered in person for the annual TrailblazerDX! With a sense of excitement and anticipation, attendees participated in over 250 sessions, hands-on workshops, and 60 product demos, all geared toward helping them improve their orgs, operations, and Trailblazing selves!

_TDX23 Agenda_

Starting around 9:45 am PST, the main keynote delivered a wealth of information, including customer stories and major product releases scheduled for Summer 2023, Winter 2024, and beyond. This included the introduction of [a new mascot](https://twitter.com/mkpartners/status/1633188603412226048?s=20), recognition of new MVPs receiving the golden hoodie, and product demos which [generated a lot of buzz](https://twitter.com/mkpartners/status/1633171587691327497?s=20) on social media.

Perhaps the biggest announcement was the unveiling of Einstein GPT, the world’s first Generative AI designed specifically for Salesforce CRM. With unlimited potential, demos showcased examples for various use cases along with a breakdown of what lies “under the hood”.

No Salesforce event is complete without the introduction of a new mascot, and this time FLO has joined the community as the latest addition. As Flow is a widely used and popular product within Salesforce, FLO the flying squirrel is here to stay and ready to become the ultimate automation assistant for trailblazers. After all, everyone can use a little help with the ebbs and flows of work.

Whether you participated virtually or in person, we thank Salesforce for organizing a remarkable show. It is always gratifying to hear from trailblazers who utilize this platform and its products to develop innovative solutions to share with others. This experience serves as an inspiration to strive for greatness and reflect upon your personal journey.

We would love to hear your thoughts and share what you look forward to next year.

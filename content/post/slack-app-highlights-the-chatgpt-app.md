As the sun makes its final celestial crossing in March and, with it, draws another calendrical Q1 to a close, there can be little doubt that ChatGPT had one of the most successful (or at least celebrated) first chapters of 2023.

And, while the case studies, customer stories, and ROI-driving best practices for the product may still be a ways off — there’s a waitlist that has a lot of attention in workplaces around the world: the ChatGPT App for Slack!

[Built by OpenAI’s Simón Posada Fishman](https://slack.com/blog/news/how-i-built-the-chatgpt-app-for-slack), the app launched earlier this month and was quickly promoted by OpenAI, Slack, [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/chatgpt-app-for-slack/), and the business world at large. The app’s still in beta, and access is being parsed out via waitlist (which [you can join right here](https://openai.com/waitlist/slack)), but the impacts of having an instance of ChatGPT in your workspace seem tremendous. In Simón’s words:

#### “You can think of the app as a second brain that is right there with you in Slack, that you can rely on for instant help as you go about your work to be a more productive person. This app can truly help you understand and digest content and answer questions quickly for you.”

Personally, I’ve used ChatGPT to help craft (though more frequently troubleshoot) [formula fields in Salesforce](https://medium.com/creme-de-la-crm/chatgpt-x-salesforce-formula-fields-34e40ac8ff1b), SQL queries for Marketing Cloud, scripts for fun side projects, and to reformat mass data to save myself a bunch of cutting and pasting or crafting an excel formula to do it. And the idea of being able to do that, straight from Slack, as opposed to having yet another tab open in my browser is certainly appealing.

Perhaps most exciting is the potential sense of having an “extra set of eyes and ears” in the Digital HQ. While I don’t think there’s any risk of ChatGPT replacing staff (even with lots of direction and prompting it can still struggle to craft compelling prose) — it’s a tremendous help in problem solving and I think it’ll be a wonderful resource for admins and devs to “[rubberduck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging)” with a more lively and capable discussion partner or to get some direction about a project or use-case approach.

So, if you’re interested in adding the power of ChatGPT, be sure to [join the waitlist here](https://openai.com/waitlist/slack) (although I’d please ask that you not cut me in line with a more moving use-case).

And, of course, if you need a hand getting your Slack or Salesforce configured or customized, have an idea for an app of your own you’d like to have built, or just want an extra set of eyes to help you ID where you might capture more ROI from either platform. [Drop us a line](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxConsultingListingDetail?listingId=a0N30000001gF9jEAE)! We’re always happy to help.

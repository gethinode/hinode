When Salesforce acquired [MapAnything](https://mapanything.com/) 6 months ago, it picked up much more than a trip-planning tool. Built natively on the Salesforce Platform, MapAnything pioneered pairing advanced, location-based information with already data-rich Salesforce orgs to produce even more intelligent, actionable info — and a variety of ROI-capturing applications!

Now, rebranded as [Salesforce Maps](https://mapanything.com/), this robust tool is being rolled out by orgs all over the world, from “Mom & Pop” shops to the Fortune 500. What may be surprising however (despite being a common arc in the product life of a tech-offering), is that customers’ creative applications are outshining even Salesforce’s most ambitious ad-copy and user-stories.

Film and TV production houses were expected to benefit from the ability to manage their rental routes, returns, and schedules, but also began to use proximity tools to ensure that their shoot locations would meet their various (and sometimes competing) union requirements.

Outside sales reps would, of course, use Salesforce Maps to plan their account-calls and incorporate prospect-visits, but it was surprising to see inside-business-development teams using location-based cues to generate call-lists and logging their efforts straight from the map screen.

With use-cases coming in from all sorts of surprising corners (law firms, real estate agencies and individual agents, insurance brokers, media, marketing, and more) we put together a 1-hour presentation and demo to share those outside-the-box successes with Salesforce Maps — and now we’re taking the show public!

On October 30th (next Wednesday) from 1:30p-2:30p Pacific time, we’ll be live and online, taking a tour through our favorite creative use cases for Salesforce Maps and running a demo showing off the most impressive, lesser-known functionality. If you’d like to join — [sign up right here](http://pardot.mkpartners.com/SalesforceMapsWebinar)!

We’ll email you calendar invite, and later, all the login details so you can watch and learn from the comfort of your home, office, or pre-Halloween prep space!

And, if you’d like the info but won’t be able to make it on Wednesday, sign up anyway and we’ll make sure to shoot you a recording of the whole thing once it’s done! (And of course we’ll respond to any questions or comments you might have, even if you can’t ask them live).

We’ll look forward to seeing you virtually next week and, until then, keep working hard, smart, and happy. We’ll see you in the cloud.

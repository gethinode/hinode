Ok, this one is definitely more of a lowlight.

As we continue our countdown to Summer ’23 (the final release weekend is only two weeks away!), today we’re mixing it up a bit by taking a look at a few features that are actually going away, as opposed to being added to the platform.

If you read the headline, and judging by the fact that you made it this far, you have — we’ll soon be [saying goodbye to News, Automated Account Fields, and Account Logos](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_account_features_news_retirement.htm&release=244&type=5).

Ok, facts first. We technically have a little bit of time to prep and plan — the News, automated account fields, and automated account logo features are being retired in all Salesforce orgs in **Winter ’24 on October 13, 2023**. So, we’ve got 1 more release and a few extra months before this will hit orgs.

And, while we can speculate on why this is happening and what Salesforce or third-party tools might be gearing up to replace it (EinsteinGPT has the shortest odds in my book) — if this is something your users love, you’ll want to keep your eyes open for a replacement or start developing your own.

This is truly one of those features that, for some C-Suite executives and Sales Leads, is a game-changer/dealbreaker. There are of course orgs that don’t use them at all, but if you have high-level users who hate when thing “stop looking like they used to” you’ll want to get planning (or setting expectations) now.

Of course, and as always, if you’d prefer to have a more personalized discussion about exactly how the change will affect your org, want someone to take a look under the hood and assure you it’ll be fine or assist making the necessary updates — [drop us a line](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxListingDetail?listingId=a0N30000001gF9jEAE)! We’re always happy to help.

Until next time, keep working hard, smart, and happy! And we’ll see you in the cloud.

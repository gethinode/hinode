There’s a lot of exciting updates heading our way in Summer ’24 (and of course we’re cataloguing our picks for the most impactful, impressive, and innovative right here) — but this one’s got all the right ingredients to be extra influential on orgs, operations, and admins!
Today we’ll be taking a look at the intersection of artificial intelligence and automation — [Einstein Generated Flow Drafts](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_automate_flow_builder_get_help_building_flows_with_einstein_for_flow.htm&release=250&type=5)!

## Automated Automation Generation

That might sound like a mouthful (and it’s probably why Salesforce chose “Let Einstein Build a Draft Flow for You” as the title for this feature in the Release Notes) but it stands to be a complete game changer in terms of the accessibility of automations in Salesforce.
It’s also almost perfectly in the center of my Salesforce career Venn Diagram. As a Salesforce Einstein Champion, I’ve had my eyes on the platform’s AI developments for years and seen it grow from, what now seems like fairly basic functionality, to suite-wide applications across the Salesforce Cloud-scape. As a [Legend of Low Code](https://www.salesforce.com/plus/series/legends_of_low_code), I live for updates and improvements to Flow that make automating processes and operations easier with clicks, and not code. And now, I get to enjoy this total Reese’s peanut butter/chocolate two-great-tastes-taste-great-together moment when the two collide!
Trailblazers will now be able to draft Flows, simply by writing out in plain text, their vision and goals, and let Einstein do the initial drafting! It’s a huge win for folks that have historically been intimidated by variables and triggers and some of the more esoteric portions of Flow construction in the past.
But don’t take my word for it — here’s Salesforce’s:
“Reach your automation goals with Einstein by describing what you want to automate and letting Einstein generative AI handle the heavy lifting. From the description you provide, Einstein creates a draft flow with elements and resources to get you started.”

“Write instructions from scratch (2), or get started with sample instructions (3).”

After your draft flow opens in Flow Builder, it’s important to check the flow for accuracy and safety. Also, be sure to debug and test the flow before activating. To get increasingly better flows from Einstein, share your feedback in the Einstein window by hovering over the Einstein message and selecting thumbs up or thumbs down (4). If the flow doesn’t meet your needs, start over in a new window (5).

See what I mean?!

## What’s It All Mean?

For admins and consultants, it’s going to make it even easier to translate your users’ visions into automations and, for your power users, it’ll even offer an opportunity to give them more runway to design on their own!
Ask them for the prompt, show them the results, and let them re-draft! Sure, you’ll still have to troubleshoot, debug, and finalize — but gone will be the “oh no, I actually thought it’d be more like this…” back and forths! And also, it might turn some of your users into willing debuggers and troubleshooters themselves! We may have a whole new crop of Salesforce Admins and Automators as a result!
Seriously! This one has the potential to be a true game changer in terms of building automations on the platform.
What’s the first Flow you’ll ask Einstein to draft up for you?
Let us know in the comments and, of course, stay tuned right here for more highlights, news, and updates on the Salesforce Summer ’24 Release as we get closer and closer to go-live!
Until next time, keep working hard, smart, and happy. And we’ll see you in the cloud!

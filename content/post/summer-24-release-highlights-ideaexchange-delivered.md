Feedback and ideas from people who use a product or service helps shape the future roadmap and improves user experience year over year. The Salesforce IdeaExchange is place where the voice of Trailblazers is heard and that allows Salesforce product managers, developers, and architects to know what changes users would like to see within the platform.
And Salesforce listens!
Let’s take a look at a few of the permissions and sharing features that are being implemented with the Summer ’24 Release because of your feedback on the [IdeaExchange](https://ideas.salesforce.com/s/)!

## User Access Summary

This [new feature](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_permisions_user_access.htm&release=250&type=5) obtains a summary report of a user’s access directly from a user’s detail page. Skip the need to review queries, profiles, permission sets, or public groups. From Setup, search and select <strong>Users</strong>, then click on <strong>View Summary</strong>. This change will apply to all the editions of Salesforce.
This summary will provide user permissions, object permissions, field permissions, custom permissions, public group membership plus more.

## Public Group Access Summary

This [new feature](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_permissions_group_summary.htm&release=250&type=5) will eliminate the need to run queries or use existing features to see where public groups are used or the level of access for each user. Obtain the one-sheet for each public group that breaks down the owner-based sharing rules, criteria-based sharing rules, reports and dashboards, list views, and more.
This change does not apply to all Salesforce editions. Make sure to check your edition if you voted for this feature. To access, go to Setup, search, and click <strong>Public Groups</strong> then click on <strong>View Summary</strong>.

## Permission Set Summary

Manage user access with this [new feature](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_permissions_perm_set_summary.htm&release=250&type=5) and identify all enabled objects, users, fields, and custom permissions within one location. With an improved interface, view custom permissions, permission sets, and permission set groups by traversing each through each tab.
This feature was already released in beta and will continue to get improvements with each new release as it will apply to all Salesforce editions. To access, go to Setup, search and select Permission Sets, click Permission Set Groups, and click <strong>View Summary</strong>.

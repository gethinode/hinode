With the weather warming up, sleeves getting shorter, and the days getting longer, it can only mean one thing: The Summer '19 Release is right around the corner!

That's right it's time for another round of updates, upgrades, and sweet new features! And, because we know you've got better beach reading lined up than release notes, it also means it's time for another series highlighting the best and biggest changes hitting orgs in June!

Today we'll talk about one of the more lighthearted additions to the sales path designed to gamify, motivate, and add some flair to the pipeline process --- [milestone celebrations](https://releasenotes.docs.salesforce.com/en-us/summer19/release-notes/rn_mobile_s1_newfeat_path_celebration.htm)!

Your office may have done away with the sales bell/horn/gong, but this Summer you’ll be able to inject some excitement back into the process for your reps with milestone celebrations!

When users reach a designated stage on the sales path (like say, winning an opportunity), you can shower their screen in digital confetti to cheer them on. Add acclaim to every step of the pipeline, your team’s current objectives, or simply to the stages that need some love (nothing helps with housekeeping like some novelty). You’ll be able to adjust the frequency of the festivities too, so the excitement won’t lose its luster from overuse.

The only other thing you’ll have to decide is whether you want to give your reps a heads up or let them be surprised by their first festive fluttering!

Generative AI is revolutionizing application development, creating the most significant shift and opportunities for developers in decades.”

Speakers are set to include Parker Harris: **Salesforce Co-founder and CTO of Slack**, Clara Shih: **CEO Salesforce AI**, Patrick Stokes: **EVP Product & Industries Marketing**, (as well as myself and some other members of the Creme de la CRM team), and more speakers are being added everyday!

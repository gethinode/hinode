The remaining Orgs in the Salesforce ecosystem have gotten their Spring ’24 push so we’re all up to date on the latest!
And with the final release weekend, we also got the Spring ’24 installment of the highly anticipated Readiness Release Live sessions! The first focus was on [Sales Cloud](https://www.salesforce.com/products/sales-pricing/) and the upcoming changes, new, and revised features. Various Product Managers (PM) talked us through a wide range of these features with a series of slide presentations and demos.

As of writing, the sessions aren’t yet available to stream but, they should be live on the [site](https://www.salesforce.com/plus/experience/release_readiness_live) by the time this is published! Below is a quick summary of valuable timestamps once the session is available.

## Trailblazers Feedback

It came as no surprise that there was a lot of talk within the chats and social media channels. While it was encouraged by the host and moderators during the session and afterward. As we collected information it made us wonder if improvements could be made (to these RRLs) for future Releases. Here’s what we managed to scrape from the feedback.

> Can you include “The Edition” or “Add-on” required when new features are introduced?
> This was a no-brainer as many people continued to push for reasons why this was not available within the Release. We feel like Salesforce teams could easily whip up a nice breakdown of each feature available within each edition (Paid/Free) and if an (Add-on) is required. Easier said than done but perhaps asking within [IdeaExchange](https://ideas.salesforce.com/s/) can get the ball rolling.

> Why can’t “Account Executives” advise on which Salesforce products and services to best optimize my company&#39;s needs?
> Another great question that got a lot of buzz and hype during the stream. As this may not pertain to the RRL directly it did catch our attention because as more and more products get introduced into the Salesforce ecosystem and more features are revised or added to each product line more product education and resources are necessary for everyone.
> There may be a disconnect that needs to be addressed between Salesforce teams and users to bridge the knowledge gap. We understand that not everyone can be an expert but progress must be made to provide new methods of understanding how to use the products and services offered.

> Can we stop getting redirected to the “Trailblazer Community” when a new feature question cannot be answered by a PM?
> Our Trailblazer Community is the best resource to use for existing features and services but for “New Features/Services” I can’t see that being the best place to get started (Especially when first launched). We understand each PM may not have the answer to every question asked but when presenting new features the (5Ws | 1H Who, What, When, Where, Why | How) should be taken into consideration.
> Feel like this is a great opportunity for Salesforce teams to review the content distributed within each RRL to ensure the 5Ws | 1H are answered within each “Feature” released.

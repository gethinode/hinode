Is Digital 360 worth the hype? The short answer is “absolutely.”

At [MK Partners](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxConsultingListingDetail?listingId=a0N30000001gF9jEAE&utm_source=mkp&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=logigear-mkp-tpp), Salesforce is really our passion. We’ve done over 2,200 projects for more than 1,200 clients — and we’re fortunate to have been registered, certified, and successful Salesforce partners for more than 15 years. We’ve seen a lot of innovation from the platform over the years and we’re particularly excited about the possibilities enabled by [Digital 360](https://www.salesforce.com/solutions/digital-360/overview/).

It allows businesses to connect with their audiences on the platforms they prefer, and the ways they want. When companies have the capabilities of understanding each individual consumer, they’re able to better suit everyone’s specific needs and desires. For example, our entertainment clients at MK Partners can deploy Digital 360 to bring together box office numbers from theaters around the world. This helps our clients better understand audience preferences and make more intelligent, data-driven marketing decisions.

Everyone knows about the importance of data. We’ve found collecting enough customer data is seldom a problem for our clients. Oftentimes, companies come to us because they need to find a way to start using it effectively. They may have visibility into the customer life cycle, but no way to access it throughout their organization. Digital 360 takes their data from across departments and ties it together into a single source of truth. This turns disparate data into actionable metrics that our clients can review and act on.

Another benefit of Digital 360: Being able to have the data in black-and-white, with the ability to build apps to use it more effectively, means companies no longer need to hire based on the ability to organize and recall information. Instead, they can look for people who have analysis and strategic thinking skills — building teams that can help the company thrive in today’s rapidly changing market.

Speaking of change, digital transactions have skyrocketed over the past year. The companies that adapted accordingly ended up excelling tremendously. You’ve probably noticed some of these changes, such as retail stores offering curbside pickup, food delivery apps offering no-contact delivery, or even being able to view your barber’s calendar to schedule a time for him or her to come to you. Plus, these businesses have a plethora of payment options, all of which have your details on file.

Because of these changes, we’ve found that companies who were using a single Salesforce cloud now need to add multiple clouds to keep up with customer needs. Digital 360 makes this much easier to implement and helps keep companies competitive, accessible, and desirable. It means you can market, sell, and engage your audience anytime, anywhere.

Beyond that, Digital 360 helps our clients better analyze their role in the customer relationship. They can look at the entire customer life cycle at a glance, and also dig in granularly to see every interaction with every department through every process. They can quickly spot opportunities for improvement. That means delivering better customer service and driving customer loyalty with every new face that comes in the “door”.

Digital 360 is so valuable to businesses because it combines industry-leading marketing, commerce, and experience clouds to help create seamless online interactions. It also has three exceptionally important aspects responsible for the success of its users:

## It’s driven by data.

By integrating your commerce systems, marketing technology, service portals, and social media together on a cloud-based platform, you can effectively create a more educated strategy.

## It’s obsessed with customers.

After compiling and organizing all of your data, you’ll be able to create personalized experiences for everyone, essentially giving you the power to please every customer.

## It’s future-proof.

Instead of a standard software update, Digital 360 is designed as an evolving technology in itself. In other words, everyone and everything else adapts to Digital 360, as it’s become the industry standard of making companies (and technologies) absolutely agile.

As you can see, Digital 360 offers customizable tools to streamline every aspect of your business. So how do you get started? Projects at MK Partners always begin with a business process walkthrough to really get an understanding of your current operations. Our goal is to take the way things work, what’s made you successful, and translate those into functional pieces of Salesforce. We’re not looking for a one-size-fits-all solution. Because we find that it doesn’t really drive adoption when you tell people who are already good at their jobs, “Hey we’ve got a new piece of technology and you’re going to have to learn how to do your job completely differently to take advantage of it.”

Instead, [let’s chat](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxConsultingListingDetail?listingId=a0N30000001gF9jEAE&utm_source=mkp&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=logigear-mkp-tpp) about what makes your business successful, the platform tools you have available, and the possibilities for improvement.

Until then, keep working hard, smart, and happy. We’ll see you in the cloud.

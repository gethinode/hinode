With the long, hot days of Summer melting away into the cool, abbreviated sunlight of September, we’re trading swimsuits for spiced-fruits, beach blankets for ski slopes, and air conditioning for seat warmers.
It also means there’s a brand new Salesforce release on the way — that’s right, we’re only weeks away from the [Winter ’20 Release](https://releasenotes.docs.salesforce.com/en-us/winter20/release-notes/salesforce_release_notes.htm)! And, because we know most people prefer raking leaves to reading release notes, we’re back with another round of highlights showing off the features, updates, and upgrades that we’re most excited to see in our orgs!
In today’s post we’ll be covering a [long-requested](https://success.salesforce.com/ideaView?id=08730000000YHmBAAW) Lightning ability that’s finally coming to Quotes, [line item sorting](https://releasenotes.docs.salesforce.com/en-us/winter20/release-notes/rn_sales_sort_quote_line_items.htm)!

Previously limited to Salesforce Classic, sales reps (and any other departmental users that need to manipulate quotes) will now be able to re-order and sort line items directly in the Lightning Experience!
Starting in Winter ’20, whether your org prefers to organize your quoted items by cost, service-type, product-type, contract terms, etc… you’ll be able to order everything just the way you like it. That preferred sort order will carry over to related opportunities and PDF quotes as well (when synced), so you and your prospects will be seeing the exact same thing when you walk through those quotes on the phone, or get a line-number reference in negotiations.
You can see the full notes on the feature release [right here](https://releasenotes.docs.salesforce.com/en-us/winter20/release-notes/rn_sales_sort_quote_line_items.htm) and, if you have any questions, [drop us a line](https://www.mkpartners.com/article/contact/contact) — we’re always happy to help!
And stay tuned to the blog here, because we’ll keep the release highlights coming until the big Winter ’20 rollout on October 11th and 12th! In the meantime, keep working hard, smart, and happy.
We’ll see you in the cloud.

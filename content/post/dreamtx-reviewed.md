Dreamforce 2020 is over, Salesforce's annual whirlwind week of news, sessions, and guest spots has come to a close, and the [recordings are up](https://medium.com/creme-de-la-crm/dreamforce-2020-highlights-recordings-and-more-2e54a6c96d73) for any and all who missed the happenings live.

Caylin watched, participated, and followed along all week and now she's back to share her thoughts on all things DreamTX (including the much-anticipated explanation of the 'TX' in DreamTX)! Join us for a review of the entire event below, from keynotes to sessions to the best celebrity guest spots.

This year Arizona’s 6th annual community conference for Salesforce developers and architects will be taking place at the [ASU SkySong Innovation Center](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Skysong+Innovations/@33.464197,-111.9257224,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x872b09668d43c8df:0xfa005986e622da2c!8m2!3d33.464197!4d-111.9231421!16s%2Fg%2F1hc25hmjf?entry=ttu). A change from previous years&#39; locations, this venue will be a first over at Scottsdale, AZ. The [official start date](https://www.cactusforce.com/) will be Friday, Jan 26th but sponsors, speakers, and MVPs will be arriving a earlier to enjoy a VIP dinner (4–6 pm) on Thursday, Jan 25th. (An add-on at Registration may be required if you wish to attend).
After the dinner, everyone attending in person is encouraged to attend the “Welcome Celebration” (6–8 pm) to indulge in the networking festivities. Make sure to [RSVP](https://trailblazercommunitygroups.com/events/details/salesforce-salesforce-developer-group-phoenix-united-states-presents-cactusforce-2024-welcome-celebration/) if you plan to attend.

## What to Expect (Weather Wise)

No matter the occasion, visiting a new location always calls for a quick check on the weather, so here’s what we’ve got in store at Scottsdale, AZ. A bit cool for those commuting from the local states but maybe just right for folks traveling from the Midwest or East. Either way, make sure to bring comfortable clothes and shoes to keep you feeling good and focused.

## The Agenda

After Thursday’s activities, the event goes into full effect on Friday, January 26th. Starting at 7 am attendees can stop by and pick up their badges at the registration desks. From there the event begins at 8 am while around +30 [Breakout Sessions and Workshops](https://www.cactusforce.com/sessions) start at 9 am and run around 40–50 minutes each. Whether it is Apex, Account Forecasting, Orchestration Loopback, Data Cloud, or more there are plenty of activities to check out throughout the day.

## Demo Jam

The “All-time Trailblazer Favorite” Demo Jam never fails to make its appearance at these community events and does so once again. Starting around 12:30 pm various ISVs/SIs will go head-to-head to demo their Apps in 3-min intervals. Trailblazers will have a chance to vote for their favorite to recognize and award a winner. Keep in mind that participants go above and beyond to create experiences that will be remembered for many years to come.

## The Whova App, Makes Its Return

With the success of last year, the [Whova App](https://whova.com/) makes its return so in case you cannot attend the event in person then register for a virtual pass to enjoy Breakout Sessions, 602 talks, Demo Jam, and more at the comfort of your desk. Download the App and maximize its use.

## Keynote

With any type of event, a “Main Speaker” or Keynote is always the talk of the event. Someone who people can resonate with and are interested in listening to what he/she/they have to say. This year it&#39;s no other than [Leah McGowen-Hare](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leah-mcgowen-hare-msed/) who spoke at CMX 2023 a few months ago. She will be having a Fireside chat that kicks off at 4 pm.

While Salesforce events tend to start with the Keynote speakers most community events will close out with them.

## The Last In-Person Networking Opportunity

As all good things must come to an end the “Closing Reception” will start at 5 pm until the last person leaves the SkySong Center. Take this opportunity to seek Trailblazers you wish to connect and network with. Wine, beer, and other drinks along with some appetizers and food may be served during this time so you can enjoy some food while having down-to-earth conversations. Leverage this time to get to know someone new.

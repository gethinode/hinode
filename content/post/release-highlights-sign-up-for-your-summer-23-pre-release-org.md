This Summer’s set to be packed with highly-anticipated releases: Barbie, Oppenheimer, and, of course, the [Salesforce Summer ’23 Release](https://medium.com/creme-de-la-crm/releasehighlights/home)!

And, while the previous weeks saw previews drop for the first two films above, this week marks a big day for sneak peeks at Salesforce Summer ’23 — Pre-Release Org Sign-Ups are live!

Admins can now sign up for a [pre-release environment](https://www.salesforce.com/form/signup/prerelease-summer23/?_ga=2.55265259.1341205535.1681922652-1161755802.1667412373&_gl=1*1f139ea*_ga*MTE2MTc1NTgwMi4xNjY3NDEyMzcz*_ga_EE9XB9ZV8F*MTY4MjExMTg3NC4xMC4wLjE2ODIxMTE4NzQuMC4wLjA.), which is full of all the Summer ’23 features, free to explore to your heart’s content! And, if you have a previous instance of a pre-release org from the Spring ’23 release, you can save yourself the signup and [simply log back into that org](https://gs0.salesforce.com/?_ga=2.164653311.1341205535.1681922652-1161755802.1667412373)! (Don’t worry, we won’t judge you for having to reset your password).

If you are signing up for a new instance, don’t overlook the option to select your Pre-Release Edition!

{{< image src="/img/1_Pn53488EtxK9r-u3ld4zYw.png">}}

Maybe you want to pick the same edition you use internally, so you can get a true preview of what’s to come (and don’t fall in love with any functionality you won’t end up seeing once the release is live). But maybe you want to see all the bells and whistles so you can get a feel for the full potential of the platform and gameplan if there’s a potential upgrade in the cards. Or maybe you’re a completionist and you’ll be using 3 emails so you can sign up for one of each (we see you, partners, and we know you’re just trying to preview the effects across your various clients’ orgs).

Whatever you decide, with release notes dropping next week, you won’t want to miss your chance to dive in and get some real demo time with all the latest features, updates, and upgrades heading to orgs everywhere — so [be sure to sign up](https://www.salesforce.com/form/signup/prerelease-summer23/?_ga=2.135809265.1341205535.1681922652-1161755802.1667412373&_gl=1*19jpozs*_ga*MTE2MTc1NTgwMi4xNjY3NDEyMzcz*_ga_EE9XB9ZV8F*MTY4MjExMTg3NC4xMC4wLjE2ODIxMTE4NzQuMC4wLjA.)!

And of course, if you’d prefer some more personalized guidance, or would rather have someone else do the research into the new release’s effects on your org, processes, and procedures — [drop us a line](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxConsultingListingDetail?listingId=a0N30000001gF9jEAE)! We’re always happy to help and love discussing the delta between your current configuration and your ideal vision for the platform.

Until next time, keep working hard, smart, and happy! And we’ll see you in the cloud.

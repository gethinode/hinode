A few months ago [we talked](https://medium.com/creme-de-la-crm/public-sector-salesforce-experts-a169bd3dd802) about a subtle change to the AppExchange that’s making it a lot easier for organizations to find best-fit partners for Salesforce implementation and celebrated our [recognition as Experts in the Public Sector](https://medium.com/creme-de-la-crm/public-sector-salesforce-experts-a169bd3dd802) space. And today we’re proud to announce another round of updates and a few more areas of expertise worth celebrating!
Along with a slew of new specializations, MK Partners is now recognized as an expert in Managed Services!

Dreamforce Everywhere, aka Dreamforce ’21, is officially in the books and the first post-pandemic, in-person Salesforce event was a hit!

The invite-only event was limited to 5,000 trailblazers, which make sit extra special that MK Partners received 3 invites in recognition of our efforts, expertise, and participation in the ecosystem.

Chris attended the event and he and Caylin caught up to recap, review, and talk about all the most exciting reveals, announcements, and updates!

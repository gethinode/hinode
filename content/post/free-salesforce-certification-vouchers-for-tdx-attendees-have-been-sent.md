If you attended this year’s TrailblazerDX at the beginning of March, you’ve got a treat in your inbox today! This morning Salesforce sent out the promised certification vouchers for folks who registered for Full Conference passes!
It’s an up to $200 value and, when coupled with the steep discounts we saw for TDX registration this year, it means this year’s was one of the most affordable TDXs in a while! Especially if you’re local and don’t have to shell out for travel and lodging. And double “especially” if you were already planning on taking a cert exam this year!

The cert voucher emails came from trailblazerdx@salesforce.com with a subject line of, “Your certification voucher from TrailblazerDX is inside” so, if you don’t see yours right away, be sure to whitelist that email address, search the subject, check your spam folder, under the couch, in between the car seats — wherever you tend to find those emails that seem to dodge the inbox!

And, once you find it, all that’s left to do is figure out which cert you’re going to tackle next! These vouchers can be used for any of Salesforce’s Administrator, Consultant, Designer, Developer, Marketer, and Sales Professional certifications, and a [full list of exams can be found right here](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/help?article=Registration-Cost-for-an-Exam)!
Make your pick, hit the books, and then pass that test! This round of professional development’s on Salesforce!
Until next time, keep working hard, smart, and happy. And we’ll see you in the cloud.

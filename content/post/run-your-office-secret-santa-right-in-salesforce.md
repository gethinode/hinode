All thanks to the [Gift Exchange app](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxListingDetail?listingId=a0N3A00000FR4UzUAL), by Salesforce.

This is admittedly exciting news for whoever your resident organizer is, but I’ll admit to feeling some minor disappointment because I was looking forward to building our own.

But as always, the [first step](https://www.salesforce.com/plus/experience/Dreamforce_2021/series/Admin/episode/episode-14) when designing any Salesforce app is to check the AppExchange and see if someone’s already done the heavy lifting for you and, once again, I was surprised and delighted by the thoroughness of the Trailblazer Community!

[The app](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxListingDetail?listingId=a0N3A00000FR4UzUAL) is pre-built with custom objects, workflows, a matching algorithm for pairing gifters with giftees, and, of course, reports so you can build a whole dashboard to keep updated, at-a-glance, on your gift exchange!

And the best part is it’ll free you up to keep doing the parts of your job you’re best at, not wrangling participants and pulling names out of a hat. And for me, it means more time to devote to a different fun app for the platform!

Stay tuned to see what we end up building next, enjoy your gift exchanges, your celebrations and, until next time, keep working hard, smart, and happy.

We’ll see you in the cloud.

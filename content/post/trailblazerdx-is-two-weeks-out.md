The first of Salesforce’s “big” annual events is on the horizon — [TrailblazerDX](https://www.salesforce.com/trailblazerdx/) is heading back to San Francisco in just two short weeks!
Formerly “TrailheaDX” (and formerly a very dev-centered event), recent years have seen it rebranded for the broader Trailblazer community and, with the newer moniker, “TrailblazerDX”.
As always, a star-studded lineup of speakers from around the Salesforce ecosystem (as well as Hollywood and the world of entertainment) will take to the stages at Moscone to share success stories, product developments, and tips for building your career, brand, or app on the platform!
This year it’s Kumail Nanjiani getting star-billing on the TDX web page, but Trailblazers will also be eager to hear from SF-event-regulars like Parker Harris and Sarah Franklin, as well as some exciting customer ambassadors, like Parul Saini of Uber and Jennifer Tim of Delta Airlines! And, because no Salesforce to-do would be to-done without a musical guest — Fallout Boy will be playing at the Masonic to close out what’s sure to be an exciting night one!

Besides a full slate of sessions, speakers, workshops, and even some bootcamp and cert opportunities, there will of course also be a slew of sponsored and community-driven happy hours, dinners, breakfasts, and “off-campus” opportunities to explore. We may even have a little something up our sleeve for Trailblazers that aren’t going to be able to attend.
Be sure to subscribe here to stay in the loop for that opporutnity as well as our collection of events gathered “through the grapevine” so you’ll be able to make the most of your trip! (And be sure to drop the meet-ups, meals, and happy hours you’re most-looking forward to in the comments!)
We’ll be counting down the days to TrailblazerDX with content right here and we can’t wait to see everyone in San Francisco!

What better day to take a look at all the things we love about Salesforce!

We asked around the office (well, the [digital HQ](https://www.salesforce.com/ap/blog/2022/03/customer-success-anywhere-digital-hq.html)), and these are our teams top picks for “What We Love About Salesforce”!

> “The Trailblazer Community”
> One of the most surprising (and amazing) things about Salesforce is the Trailblazer Community. Helpful, friendly, and absolutely massive — there’s no real comparison. Software doesn’t have fans, right? Well that’s fine for the platform that’s famously **not **Software.

> “The events!”
> Local Trailblazer Meetups, Regional Community Dreamin’ Events, TDX and, of course, [Dreamforce](http://dreamforce.com) it feels like there’s always something on the Salesforce events calendar and they’re always worth the trip. From professional connections, practical skills, and in-depth looks at new features, there’s always something to learn, someone to meet, and the chance to share your knowledge!

> “The opportunities for creative problem solving”
> With so many unique use-cases and so many tools, features, and approaches — there’s rarely only one “right” way to do things in Salesforce. All that configurability and room for customization, along with no-code, low-code, or pro-code approaches make every Salesforce project a chance to create a new solution or adjust, edit, and perfect a previously successful approach. And that keeps things fresh and fun!

> “The room for career growth”
> From platform certifications, superbadges, and the least gatekeep-y community around — it feels like every day in the Salesforce ecosystem offers opportunities for professional growth. In fact, most Trailblazers can probably tell you exactly who and what helped them at every step along their Salesforce career journey!

> “The concerts”
> Sure these are fairly event specific, but without Salesforce I never would have seen the Foo Fighters, Weezer, Metallica, the Black Eyed Peas, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Lenny Kravitz, Jennifer Hudson, and more performing live!

> “The mascots”
> Whether you love Astro, Ruth, Codey, or Brandy best — there’s nothing like scoring a plush of your favorite mascot or some wearable swag featuring their smiling faces to rep on the next coffee chat call!

> “The friends I’ve made”
> Every job creates colleagues, Salesforce creates friendships. And that’s just incredible.

> “The orgs I’ve helped”
> Whether you work for a partner helping multiple clients, at an organization helping manage Salesforce for a division or team, or at Salesforce itself keeping the lights on for all of us, it’s incredible to consider all the users you’ve helped and the use-cases, processes, and workflows you’ve helped improve. Rarely do professions provide such regular, quantifiably rewarding achievements.

> “The 3 annual releases”
> 3 times a year Salesforce gets even better. And we’re part of the whole process. From [voting on roadmap priority](https://medium.com/creme-de-la-crm/shape-the-salesforce-product-roadmap-prioritization-voting-is-live-until-feb-13-f1f9505055f4?source=collection_home---4------0-----------------------), testing new features in beta release or pilot orgs, to release notes, [highlights](https://medium.com/creme-de-la-crm/releasehighlights/home), and more — Salesforce is always improving and, therefore, so too is our experience and enjoyment of it.

> “Trailhead!”
> Last, but not least, Trailhead! For many, it’s their intro to Salesforce. For everyone, it’s where continuing education and development happens. A free LMS, packed with opportunities to improve, learn about new products, prep for certs, and earn some badges and bragging rights. Not to mention the free Trailhead orgs for modules, projects, and the occasional “fun” side-creation!
> At MK[ Partners](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxConsultingListingDetail?listingId=a0N30000001gF9jEAE), we’re lucky to have been in this relationship with Salesforce since 2006, and we still find new things to love every day. We hope you and yours have a happy Valentine’s Day and please do drop your favorite things about Salesforce in the comments!

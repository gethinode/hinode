Another short week, just like me. I’m pretty sure I’ve used this line before, but I’m so short that I can use it multiple times. I’ve got just three events for you, so no need to buckle up. Just sit back, open up your calendars and let’s get planning!

So our first event of the week actually has multiple sessions just in case you can’t make this time. Trailhead News has an [Exclusive Interview](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/live/broadcasts/a2r3k000001vDR3/trailhead-news---exclusive-interview) to talk about the new Developer site being updated and relaunched! The first broadcast will take place on Monday, August 2nd at 4:30pm (PST) and will have replays of it throughout the week. In this 15 minute event (see no reason not to attend) you will hear how Helen Hosian, the Art Director of the project, worked on this project. You will hear about the what and why it changed, and what to look forward to in the future.

Our second event, [Simplifying the Complexity of Cross-Channel Advertising Sales](https://www.salesforce.com/form/events/webinars/form-rss/3322833), is occurring on Wednesday, August 4th at 9:00am (PST). Nowadays there are many ways to reach your audience, to the point where it’s becoming too much. However, there is not one way for companies to do it all and simplify the process, except with, well, Media Cloud. This panel discussion will cover challenges and myths around advertising sales, the evolution of advertising sales, and how Media Cloud can simplify all of this. So if your company is ready to increase advertising revenues, then you should sign up!

Our final and third event of the week is not technically a Salesforce event, but instead a Slack event. You should know by now that Salesforce acquired Slack, but it became official this week (go ahead and check out Chris Stegall’s [blog post about it](https://medium.com/creme-de-la-crm/slack-salesforce-how-to-catch-up-on-the-new-paradigm-378b7841c727)! The first of many Slack related events coming our way now, [Building for the Slack App Directory](https://slack.com/events/webinars/building-for-the-slack-app-directory), is an hour long event geared for Developers. Also on Wednesday, August 4th this event will teach Developers more about the Slack App Dictionary and the ins and outs of building a Slack app. They will also give advice on how to launch your app, including marketing tips. This event starts at 10am (PST).

## Recap

Last week was very educational, starting off with _Why Every CSR and HR Team Needs a Disaster Relief & Readiness Plan_. This event taught viewers how to be proactive when disaster strikes, such as how to create a playbook that HR can activate for the C-level executives and employees, as well as building relationships with other companies and nonprofits to get immediate relief. Salesforce gave nonprofits 5 tips in _Integration Payment Considerations for Nonprofits_. We got to work more on our UN SD goals in _Drive Climate Action with Supply Chain Data_, where viewers learned about supply chain emissions and how they are affecting businesses, how to enable your leadership team, and taking steps to a more sustainable future.

In _Grow Revenue with a Hybrid B2B Sales Model: The Digitally Powered Sales Team_ viewers learned how selling online will directly impact your sales team and how to create a hybrid model to make your customers happy. On a similar note, _Consumer Goods and the Great B2B Digital Acceleration_ taught consumer goods companies how to pivot to become both digital and face to face in order to serve their customers.

And, as always, we will see you in the cloud!

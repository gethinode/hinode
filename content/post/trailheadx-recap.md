TrailheaDX was last week and (based on the reviews) may have been the best virtual Salesforce event to date!

If you didn’t get a chance to attend live, you can (register and) catch replays of all the keynotes, campfires, and sessions [right here](http://www.trailheadx.com).

We saw exciting new pilot features, an overhaul of Trailhead and the Trailblazer community, and more! [Chris and Caylin sat down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJXP-gy0qcY) to talk through the event, tell you which sessions are worth a watch, and hit some of their highlights and takeaways from the last major Salesforce event before Dreamforce returns in September!

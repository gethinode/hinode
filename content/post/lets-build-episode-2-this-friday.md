Last Friday we went live with episode 1 of our brand new Let's Build series and we brainstormed our way into building a field mapper to make admin lives even easier --- tomorrow, we're tackling the development!

If you missed the first episode, catch up below to take a peek at how Salesforce ideas are developed (and pick up some handy url shortcuts too, like how to launch a new google doc, right from the url bar!):

And then be sure to tune in Friday, August 21st at 11am PST for episode 2! It'll be live at [the link right here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3Yz1SsVMk4).

Be sure to [let us know](https://www.mkpartners.com/contact/) if there are any features or functions you'd like to see added, or if you have an idea for what we should build next!

Until then, keep working hard, smart, and happy --- we'll see you in the cloud.

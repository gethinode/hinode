As community conferences (aka Dreamin’ events) ramp up this time of the year, you’ll probably notice more and more Salesforce snapshots in your social feeds that give a glimpse of what these events are all about. In just two weeks Salesforce admins, developers, architects, marketers, and more will head back to the [AT&amp;T Executive Conference Center](https://meetattexas.com/) once again for Texas Dreamin’!
This year’s installment will bring Trailblazers back to Austin, TX, and kick off by hosting sponsors, speakers, and potential MVPs at a Speakers Reception between 6–8 pm on Wednesday, May 29th.
Let’s Dive In.

## What to Expect (Weather Wise)

No matter the occasion, visiting a new city always calls for a quick check on the weather, so here’s what we’ve got in store for Austin, TX. A hot summer drive for those commuting from the local states but a nice “summer vibes” getaway for folks traveling from the Midwest or East. Either way, make sure to bring sunscreen, light comfortable clothes, and comfy shoes to keep you cool and focused.

## The Agenda

After Wednesday’s activities, the [agenda](https://www.texasdreamin.org/agenda.html) goes into full effect on Thursday, May 30th. The opening Keynote starts at 9 am and from there the event sessions, extended sessions, breakouts, and ongoing activities take place. If you need to update your headshot for the next interview, LinkedIn profile, or passport renewal then make sure to swing by the Headshot photo locations available each day.

## Demo Jam

The “All-time Trailblazer Favorite” Demo Jam never fails to make its appearance at these community events and does so once again. The times are still up for grabs on the agenda but ISVs will go head-to-head to demo their Apps in 3-min intervals. Trailblazers will then have a chance to vote for their favorite to recognize and award a winner. Keep in mind that participants go above and beyond to create experiences that will be remembered for many years to come.

## The Whova App, Takes Over Once Again

If this is your first time attending a community conference then you will quickly begin to familiarize yourself with the [Whova App](https://whova.com/), which is your all-in-one event management platform. Download the App, connect with attendees, and join a meetup or group discussion from the palm of your hand.

## Keynote Speakers

With any type of event, the main Speaker(s) or Keynote is always the talk of the event. Someone who people can resonate with and are interested in listening to what he/she/they have to say. This year it’s none other than [Ann Weeby](https://www.linkedin.com/in/annweeby/) and [Guilda Hilarie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ghilaire/) who are well known and established in the Salesforce ecosystem. Ann will kick off the opening ceremony while Guilda will be closing the event.

## In-Person Networking Opportunities

Many attendees enjoy these types of community conferences because it allows them to connect with new and existing Trailblazers. With the transition to remote work, existing colleagues meet for the first time during these events. Wine, beer, and other drinks along with some appetizers and food may be served during the networking receptions so, enjoy some food and have a down-to-earth conversation with another attendee.

My best friend texted me earlier today saying that “it still feels like January” and she’s right! We are almost done with winter, and I’ve just realized that! I don’t think I’ve made any winter related jokes in my posts either! And even worse, I still haven’t thought of something! So I guess you should sit back, open up your calendars and get planning, while I think of something clever for next week’s post before it’s too late.

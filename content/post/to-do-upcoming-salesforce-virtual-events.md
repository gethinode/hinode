As events are cancelled or postponed, and meetings made scarce or moved online, it can be easy to disconnect — to try to protect your expectations from being dashed by yet another “update” email or (hopefully) a refund.
But having things to look forward to is important. And, in these uncertain times, maybe even more important — as that event-optimism also reverberates a now nostalgic note of normalcy.
The Salesforce community, its culture, and its people have always been one of the best parts of the platform’s ecosystem and, while we may not have the chance to see some of our friends face-to-face for a while, the community’s ensuring that there’s still plenty of socializing, learning, and sharing to be done in 2020. In today’s post we’ll be taking a look at the upcoming events we’re looking forward to most. Best of all, because these are remote, they’ll be open to people all over the world, as opposed to just those able to make the trip.
Get your calendars ready, and let’s dive in!

## Connections

Salesforce [Connections](https://www.salesforce.com/connections/) is the annual event for the platforms’ users and partners interested in improving their connection with their clients. Covering the latest and greatest in [Marketing](https://www.salesforce.com/products/marketing-cloud/overview/), [Commerce](https://www.salesforce.com/products/commerce-cloud/overview/), and [Service](https://www.salesforce.com/products/service-cloud/overview/), you can learn from the world’s best on how to improve the relationship between your organization and your customers — and how to manage that relationship more effectively in Salesforce.
And, while the physical conference won’t be happening this year, the good news is it’ll be going remote and, now, it’ll be open to everyone! You can [register here](https://www.salesforce.com/form/event/cnx-register/), and you’ll be in the loop as soon as dates, speakers, and how to get access are finalized!

## TrailheaDX

[TrailheaDX](https://www.salesforce.com/trailheadx/) is the annual conference for Salesforce developers, app-builders, and admins — anyone who builds on, or customizes in, the platform. It’s where the Trailblazer community comes together to learn, share, make connections, and give back. And this year it’s virtual, so everyone can join in — no matter where they call home!
Just like Connections, all you have to do is [register here](https://www.salesforce.com/form/event/tdx20-stay-up-to-date/) and they’ll keep you posted on all the important details, so you can update your calendar accordingly!

## LA Admin Cinco de Mayo

Lastly, and a bit more local, on May 5th the [LA Admin Group](https://trailblazercommunitygroups.com/los-angeles-ca-administrators-group/) is hosting a [Distantly Social Cinco de Mayo Party](https://trailblazercommunitygroups.com/events/details/salesforce-los-angeles-ca-administrators-group-presents-distantly-social-cinco-de-mayo-party/)! Where admins from all over the southland will be able to come together (apart) and network, swap stories, and best practices.
Obviously, this one’s not ideal if you’re outside of LA, but [click here to find your local Trailblazer group](https://trailblazercommunitygroups.com/#chapters-page) and find out what’s being planned in your area! These local groups provide some real, region-focused insight and are a great way to meet the community members in your neighborhood. And, if you live in LA, [sign up](https://trailblazercommunitygroups.com/events/details/salesforce-los-angeles-ca-administrators-group-presents-distantly-social-cinco-de-mayo-party/) so we can see you on May 5th!
As always, [follow us here](https://pardot.mkpartners.com/subscribe) to stay up to date on all the latest in the world of Salesforce and, in the meantime, keep working hard, smart, and happy.
We’ll see you in the cloud.

AI jumped from a seemingly endless “demo” cycle (“this one can play chess”, “this one can play jeopardy”) to fully-developed data tools and now admins, devs, and executives everywhere are eager to ensure they’re equipped to use, understand, and implement it effectively.

As a [Salesforce Einstein](https://www.salesforce.com/products/einstein/overview/) Champion, I get the inside scoop on some of the coolest new developments in the space, and I’m excited to announce that the world of AI is about to get a lot more accessible! Salesforce is launching a new series of webinars to help everyone harness the power of artificial intelligence, whatever your current level of comfort!

On July 15th, Episode 1 will help you skill up on key AI concepts, use cases, and hands-on demos from Salesforce product managers, data scientists, and special guests. You’ll walk away knowing how to use the Salesforce Platform to create intelligent experiences that empower every user.

It’ll actually be a double-feature, with a session at 9am PST and one at 4pm PST so, whatever your timezone, you’ll be able to tune in to the one that works for you!

At the 9am session, I’ll be doing Livechat support, so it’ll be a great chance to get your Q’s A’d by myself and the leading business users, developers, and the whole Salesforce Einstein team!

And you can register right now, [right here](https://www.salesforce.com/form/event/learn-ai-with-salesforce/)!

Sign up today, and we’ll see you on the 15th!

And, as always, if you want a more personalized look at how AI can transform your organization’s processes or just need some help getting your tech and vision aligned, [drop us a line](https://www.mkpartners.com/contact/)! We’re always happy to help.

Until then, keep working hard, smart, and happy — we’ll see you in the cloud.

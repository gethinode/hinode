In 2021, which was **somehow **3 years ago, Salesforce launched [Salesforce+](https://www.salesforce.com/plus/), their streaming source for high-quality, Hollywood-style-productions designed to center content that can help Trailblazers grow their careers and clients grow their companies, on their own time.
Because Salesforce+ is produced by Salesforce, you’ll also find the company’s big events like Dreamforce, TDX, etc… there as well, but the real draw is Salesforce’s new original shows and virtual learning made for specific roles and industries. Oh yeah, and everything is free and unlimited!
Now that we’re a few years in (and into new seasons of some of the fan-favorite shows) we think it’s about time to do a round-up of our picks for Must-Watch Original Series on Salesforce+!
Let’s dive in!

## Trailblazer

One of the first big hits on Salesforce+, [](https://www.salesforce.com/plus/series/trailblazer)highlights inspiring leaders who’ve transformed their lives and built success with Salesforce.

With [season 2 available now](https://www.salesforce.com/plus/series/trailblazer), it’s the perfect chance to jump in (or jump back in) to learn how folks have found success in the Salesforce ecosystem, helped empower their communities and elevate those around them, and found their home as admins, devs, and business leaders around the world.
The stories are truly inspirational, offer lessons that are often directly applicable to our own professional and personal pursuits, and give you a chance to “get to know” some of the people you’re sure to see on stage and screen at Salesforce events like Dreamforce, Community Dreamin’ events and TDX!

## Legends of Low Code

Salesforce’s first foray into the world of reality-competition-style shows, [](https://www.salesforce.com/plus/series/legends_of_low_code) takes a well-known formula from shows like **Chopped**, **Project Runway**, and **Iron Chef **and applies it to the Salesforce platform with an eye on Admin-friendly Automation.

9 Trailblazers from around the world meet in San Francisco, are split into 3 teams, and given 2 days to build a winning app for a non-profit in need. Each team then presents their solution, **Shark Tank** style, and the judges (which of course includes the organization that’ll be using the app) pick the winner!
The [winning team](https://www.salesforce.com/plus/series/legends_of_low_code) earns $10,000 for the charity of their choice and, of course, a Dreamforce-sized helping of bragging rights.
It’s a terrific look at how quickly a Salesforce solution can come together, without a ton of code, and how experienced admins and architects approach a use case, challenge, and deliver a solution! And, with the whole 3-episode run totaling out to about 45-minutes, it’s also a great series to show parents and friends who ask, “so what exactly is Salesforce, again?”
Full disclosure — I’m also a huge fan of the show because I was one of the contestants. Did I win? You’ll have to watch to find out!

## How I Solved It

Last, but not least, [](https://www.salesforce.com/plus/series/how_i_solved_it)\*\* \*\*(which also has a new Season out now!) gives viewers a closer look at how Salesforce Admins solve business problems using automation, data, and security tools.

Tonally, **HISI **is sort of a blend between [](https://www.salesforce.com/plus/series/trailblazer)and [](https://www.salesforce.com/plus/series/legends_of_low_code)\*\* \*\*in that it highlights individual Trailblazer’s inspirational efforts, but with more of a focus on individual use-cases and business requirements — just without the time pressure or dramatic musical stings of a reality competition.
The show features all sorts of common, and more creative, use cases like managing user requests, automation, combining Slack and Flow, applying CRM Analytics, and more! It’s well worth a watch for new and experienced admins alike.
And of course, once you’ve finished those series, there’s still a ton more to watch! And who knows, keep your eyes peeled on the [Trailhead Community](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/trailblazer-community/feed?tab=questions) and you might see an opportunity to audition for one of the shows yourself!
Until next time, keep working hard, smart, and happy. And we’ll see you in the cloud.

The 1999 Saab 9–3 Viggen Model: A Major Upgrade in Terms of Horsepower From the Base Model

Keeping track of activity across Marketing Cloud, especially the new program upgrades from the Winter ’23 release, is critical. The new Slack app provides upgraded & powerful alerts — allowing teams to adjust core processes, set rules to avoid issues, and create automations & workflow rules when necessary. Setting rules to prevent problems via Slack allows the use of prebuilt Marketing Cloud workflow rules to identify core issues = EG: Slow automation runtimes prior to creating campaign disruptions within Business Units.

For Instance, the new Digital Command Center for the Slack app provides teams with a monitoring tool for Marketing Cloud activity, directly in slack. A user can actively identify and resolve campaign inconsistencies prior to disrupting their business model. This includes alerts on various Journey Builder Program performance(s). The Digital Command Center for Slack app course corrects actions within various alerts = EG: Creating an independent channel, opening a support ticket, or analyzing an alert with upgrade details in Marketing Cloud.

**So, What Exactly are the New High Level User Programs for Slack?**

1. **Digital Command Center = Monitor automation activity in Marketing Cloud as well as identify problems & edit campaigns ahead of time.**

**2. Account Engagement = Provide sales representatives with automated & personal notifications on real-time prospect activity.**

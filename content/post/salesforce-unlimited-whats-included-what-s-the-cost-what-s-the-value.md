If you missed the introduction of Salesforce’s [newest (and most expensive) pricing tier](https://www.forrester.com/blogs/salesforce-debuts-new-high-end-editions-for-sales-and-service/) back in September, well, it wouldn’t be actually be that surprising considering its somewhat quiet launch in the midst of all the flash and pageantry of [Dreamforce](https://www.salesforce.com/dreamforce/). But now that the confetti’s cleared at Moscone, Salesforce product-page-browsers are beginning to notice a new top tier in Sales Cloud and Service Cloud: Unlimited+!
{{< image src="/img/1_dwKAYzyVzmo6fNYULiWXPA.png" title="Image" >}}

Unlimited+ (occasionally also shortened to “UE+” for Unlimited Edition+ by blogs and Trailblazers in the ecosystem) replaces Unlimited Edition as Salesforce’s top pricing tier and, fittingly, describes itself including:
On the [Sales Cloud](https://www.salesforce.com/products/sales-pricing/) side:

<ul><li>“Everything in Unlimited plus Performance Management, Enablement and Team Collaboration with Slack” and the ability to “Connect Salesforce and External Data with Data Cloud and Revenue Intelligence”</li></ul>And on the [Service Cloud](https://www.salesforce.com/products/service-pricing/) side it boasts:
<ul><li>Robust generative &amp; predictive AI</li><li>Unify data &amp; channels with Data Cloud and Tableau Analytics</li><li>Slack collaboration &amp; productivity</li></ul>But what’s actually included to justify the $170 per user, per month increase from Unlimited (that’s over $2,000 per year, per user!)? It turns out that cutting through the buzzwords on this product tier is actually a bit tricky. Some of the additions and inclusions are more obvious than others — [Slack](http://www.slack.com), for instance.
And it’s easy to make the assumption that you’ll be getting a “combo deal” of sorts, with a bunch of separate items off the Salesforce menu, with a discount for buying them together. Of course, that then requires you to do the “value math” of whether you’re actually saving money, or adding products that you otherwise could have gone without just to “claim” some savings, when in reality you’re spending more.
Honestly, I’d love to assume that at this tier, you just get everything and it’s an easy way to make sure nothing in the Salesforce product library is walled off from you, but I’d definitely want to see that in writing first.
Of course, if we expand the features-per-tier lists, they really don’t do much to impart the apparent value of opting for the ‘+’:
**(Note: It’s a long feature list, but I highlighted the relevant bits so you can skim, and I promise there’s more writing below if you just keep scrolling)**

So, yeah, the only specifically called-out differentiators are, “The Best of Salesforce for Sales” whose info pop-out has to do the following heavy lifting,
{{< image src="/img/1_Y8PuJyscEn9TLkQ5rCSNkA.png" title="Image" >}}

And the three Slack bullets: “Slack, Slack Sales Elevate, and Knowledge”.
Perhaps most disappointing though is the “Available for Purchase” on Flow Orchestration which indicates that UE+ won’t include everything, but will still have some products and services behind additional pay gates.
So is it worth an extra $2000+ per user per year? Wellllllll, it probably depends on how much you’re currently paying in add-ons on top of your license tier and whether or not you can capture some savings this way.
On the other hand, will this potentially be valuable for Salesforce as a sales tool to make Unlimited edition more appealing because now finance departments can say “well, we talked them down from the top tier and we’re not splurging and going for “+”, so we’re being a bit thrifty!”? Maybe.
Or maybe we just don’t have enough insight yet into exactly what’s included and how they’re planning on marketing it — but there’s good news on that front as well! On December 5th, Salesforce is hosting a [webinar ](https://www.salesforce.com/form/events/webinars/form-rss/4402289?d=7010M000000uW0VQAU&nc=7013y000002EnBGAA0&eid=dy-sc-wb&utm_source=dynamic&utm_campaign=demgen-amer-us-us-sales-none-&utm_content=webinar-o1-sbe-12/5%20Sales%20Cloud%20Webinar%20%20Introducing%20Sales%20Cloud%20Unlimited+:%20The%20Best%20%20Primary-consideration-a0U7y000001iAEQEA2--&utm_medium=email&)to “introduce” the tier (and [we’ll be livestreaming](https://www.youtube.com/mkpartners) it)!

So be sure to add the event to your calendars, [subscribe to our channel](https://www.youtube.com/mkpartners), and tune in on the 5th where we’ll hope to get a better understanding of all the bells and whistles included with UE+! In all likelihood, it could be that Salesforce themselves have just been ironing out the last bits of where everything’s going to land tier-wise as we move towards 2024, and they’re finally ready to start sharing and marketing in full.
In either case, we’ll see you on the 5th — and, until then, keep working hard, smart, and happy.
And we’ll see you in the cloud!

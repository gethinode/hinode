As we continue our countdown to the world-leading CRM’s biggest event, we keep picking up new bits of information that inspire anticipation. Today, Salesforce announced the keynote speakers to expect to see in San Francisco!

Alongside perpetual Dreamforce keynote deliverer and Salesforce CEO, Marc Benioff, attendees in San Francisco (and those tuning in virtually around the world) will be looking forward to hearing from big names in entertainment, like Will Smith and Jane Fonda, the business world, like Daimler and Mercedes-Benz CEO Ola Källenius and ENGIE CEO Catherine MacGregor, and a host of other relevant thought-leaders and world-changers on the keynote platform. The full list is [available here](https://www.salesforce.com/dreamforce/speakers/).

And years of Dreamforce attendance will tell us that, while the big names take the main stage, some of the most informative, entertaining, and enlightening content will be from those smaller spin-off sessions devoted specifically to roles, products, and verticals that really dive into the day-to-day use cases where Salesforce shines. So don’t forget to use the [Dreamforce agenda builder](https://www.salesforce.com/dreamforce/schedule/) to build your personally-tailored experience.

And this year will also mark the inaugural introduction of Salesforce+, an on-demand addition to Dreamforce that will make helpful sessions, demos, and discussions available worldwide for the entire length of the conference! You definitely won’t want to miss MK Partners’ admin session on Salesforce+: Top 10 Ways Admins Can Supercharge Their Salesforce ROI.

As soon as the platform goes live-we’ll update the links and blast out the address so you can tune in!

We can’t wait to see you at Dreamforce!

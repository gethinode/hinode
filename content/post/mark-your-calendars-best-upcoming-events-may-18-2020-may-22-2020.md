This will be a hands on learning experience and if you are already familiar with flow, then hey, they want to hear your ideas too! Additionally, if you are an OC Member you have a chance to win a free Salesforce Certification Voucher, aka gold! Just make sure you get the date to their next event, as this is a two part event.

The Spring ’24 Release Weekends are beginning and with them a new year to look forward to as we seek new experiences, challenges, and obstacles to “Blaze A New Trail”. Partners, Consultants, Admins, and Users all over the world will be spending this entire month learning, testing, and trying all the new Salesforce functionality that just dropped with this new release, it’s a perfect time for Mambo Merge users to brush up on their skills with our speedy demo of updated functionality, and submit all your questions to get the most pressing answers in tomorrow’s the next installment of [Mambo Merge ‘Office Hours](https://cloud.news.mambomerge.app/officehours)’!
It’s a chance to get a quick beginner’s intro to the app, get some experience building templates of your own, help shape future development, and request the new features you’d like to see most!
For those already using our App we “Thank You” and look forward to connecting with you once more this year. We have lots of new features and functionality available, so we encourage you to sit down, pour a cup of coffee or tea, and join us.
The session will take place on Thursday, January 18th at 10:00 am (PT), and you can sign up using [this link right now](https://cloud.news.mambomerge.app/officehours)!

If you can’t make it, but still have a question (or have a complicated question that you think we might want some time to consider), go ahead and [toss it on the form here](https://forms.gle/xhg2uwkCjk5zmN1ZA) and we’ll be sure to address it on the call and email you back with the answer too (if you’d like)!
You’ll want to install [Mambo Merge](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxListingDetail?listingId=a0N3u00000MBinOEAT) ahead of time as well, so grab a free, up-to-date edition from the [AppExchange](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxListingDetail?listingId=a0N3u00000MBinOEAT) (or ask an admin too) and we’ll look forward to seeing you there!
Until then, keep working hard, smart, and happy. We’ll see you in the cloud.

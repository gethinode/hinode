It's Day 2 of [Dreamforce 2020](https://www.salesforce.com/dreamforce/at-a-glance/) (a.k.a. Dreamforce to You, a.k.a. DreamTX) and we're full speed ahead on Salesforce news, updates, and customer stories!

Day 1 focused on Customer 360, and today's focus is on "working in the new normal" --- so everything from adapting to remote work, to capturing new sources of revenue, and how Salesforce's customers have been weathering 2020. Here's a quick video run down of what to expect from Day 2!

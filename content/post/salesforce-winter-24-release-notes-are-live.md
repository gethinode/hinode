It’s that time of year again — the seemingly-speediest section of the Salesforce calendar where the combination of [Community Events](https://medium.com/creme-de-la-crm/join-us-in-the-twin-cities-12f0acbe3a61) and the countdown to [Dreamforce](https://dreamforce.com/) cause the days to fly by with avalanche-esque acceleration. And, as the long days of Summer begin to shorten once again, and San Francisco preps for the annual influx of Trailblazers, it also means we’re rapidly approaching the third and final Salesforce release of the year — [the Winter ’24 Release](https://admin.salesforce.com/blog/2023/admin-winter-24-release-dates-countdown)!
This time the Winter release’s rollout will actually span Dreamforce, with the first release weekend hitting early-adopter orgs on September 1st with the remaining rollout taking place on the weekends of October 6th and 13th.

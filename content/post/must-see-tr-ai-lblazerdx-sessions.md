## Conclusion

Many speakers find ways to share their sessions within the Trailblazer community through various mediums. People watching from home or in-person at the event cannot attend every session and we feel each session has a way of connecting with one or many individuals.
That is why we encourage Trailblazers to share their sessions and connect with others on the World Wide Web.
If you’d like to have a Speaker Spotlight or Session Coverage at any of the Salesforce or Community Events feel free to reach out to our team at marketing@cremedelacrm.com
Until next time, keep working hard, smart, and happy! And we’ll see you in the cloud.

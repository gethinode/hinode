As we say “goodbye” to 2023 and welcome 2024, the [Spring ’24 Release Notes](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.salesforce_release_notes.htm&release=248&type=5) have been unwrapped and Trailblazers everywhere are poring over them in the new year! Let’s slip into some comfy clothes, enjoy a nice cup of tea or coffee, and begin our quest to break down some of the highlights.
In today’s [Release Highlights](https://medium.com/creme-de-la-crm/releasehighlights/home) post, will take a look at some of the new and exciting updates, upgrades, and features that are headed to Marketing Cloud Account Engagement (the product formerly known as Pardot)!

##

Each new year comes with new changes in laws, regulations, compliance requirements, and best practices, so it’s no surprise to marketers that starting as early as February 2024, new spam prevention regulations will be applied by [Google](https://blog.google/products/gmail/gmail-security-authentication-spam-protection/) and [Yahoo](https://blog.postmaster.yahooinc.com/post/730172167494483968/more-secure-less-spam) to their email servers. As this was first announced earlier in October, Salesforce has prepped for the changes by recommending [All Marketing Cloud Account Engagements Accounts] to update their sending domains with verified DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM). This [change](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_mcae_sending_domains.htm&release=248&type=5) will apply to all Account Engagement editions.

Updating domains with DKIM makes it harder for email spoofing and phishing attempts to succeed by authenticating each email sent with a digital signature included within the header. Email servers like Yahoo and Google can use this additional layer of information to verify and authenticate both the email and its sender. But, to ensure that those email clients know your Account Engagement (Pardot) emails are actually from you (remember, they’ll look like they’re coming from Salesforce servers), you’ll need to set up DKIM correctly!

In June of last year, Salesforce hosted the first “[Salesforce AI Day](https://www.salesforce.com/plus/experience/salesforce_ai_day/series/salesforce_ai_day/episode/episode-s1e1)” in which they introduced their vision for the future of AI within the ecosystem. They continued building on that foundation all the way up to [Dreamforce](https://www.salesforce.com/dreamforce/), ultimately having the biggest AI event for Trailblazers throughout the world!
And with each new set of Release Notes, Einstein AI continues to develop and present itself in new ways, or get new applications on the platform. shape, or form — like this addition of Einstein Assistant to MCAE! This new [change](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_mcae_einstein_assistant.htm&release=248&type=5) will allow marketers to use Einstein to directly create content!
Admins and marketers will be able to create forms, landing pages, email subject lines, and email body copy with Einstein Assistant for Account Engagement — and it’ll be available in Account Engagement Advanced and Premium editions and in Lightning Experience in Enterprise, Unlimited, and Performance editions and

We’ll have to wait just a little longer to see this in real-time and live in our sandbox orgs, but we can’t wait to see what’s possible.
We’ll also be staying tuned (and you should too!) for the Release Overview, Reelase Trailhead Module, and Release Readiness Live event to give us more details as well.

[As of Sep 19th](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=000396380&type=1), Salesforce customers with Enterprise Edition (EE) or higher can now get Data Cloud at no additional cost. With the ability to consolidate data across multiple sources, one will now be able to import email engagement data into Data Cloud from Account Engagement by enabling the Account Engagement connector. With this [new change](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_mcae_import_data_cloud.htm&release=248&type=5), you’ll be able to leverage Data Cloud resources to build comprehensive profiles of your customers and tailor them to new marketing efforts.
Expand use cases by having Data Cloud help clean, dedupe, and organize data from various Account Engagement sources. Develop new targeting specific groups to yield more successful engagement between campaigns.

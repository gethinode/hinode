With Halloweekend behind us, it’s officially time to acknowledge the changing leaves, the shortening days, and the quickly brisk-ening air — it’s Fall, or as we call it, “Autmn-ation” — the season of time-savings!
Salesforce Admins and Devs alike know the feeling of successfully automating a previously manual task. Whether it’s saving yourself time and clicks or saving someone else the effort (arguably better because you usually get heaps of compliments an gifts and accolades, at least in a perfect world), the free-ing feeling of power and accomplishment is hard to beat!
And, while for years the Salesforce tools of choice for automation were Workflows and Process Builder processes, the introduction of Salesforce Flow in 2019 really opened up automation for everyone!
It’s a powerful tool with a lot of depth and functionality so, whether you’ve been using Flow Builder for the last 4 years, or this is your introduction, it feels like there’s always more to learn and room for improvement. That’s why we went ahead and whipped up this handy [Flow-vember Trailmix](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/users/cstegall/trailmixes/flow-vember)!
{{< image src="/img/1_T82R8Q1Cm7y8DcM4MkZLpw.png" title="Image" >}}

So you can spend the month getting up to speed and Autumn-ating like a pro!
And, because it’s Trailhead, if you’ve already completed some of these trails, modules, or projects, they’ll already be checked off for you. So no watsed time, or duplicated effort! (Although I have to admit I’ve definitely “retaken” some modules when I’ve found myself a few years away from the source material.
So [hop in](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/users/cstegall/trailmixes/flow-vember) and [get started](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/users/cstegall/trailmixes/flow-vember)!
We’ll be spending the month whipping up additional how-to’s, project ideas, and sharing some Flow success stories from the community, so stay tuned for those. And, of course, if you have any questions about automation, or need a hand getting your Flows off the ground — [drop us a line](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxConsultingListingDetail?listingId=a0N30000001gF9jEAE)! We’re always happy to help.
Until next time, keep working hard, smart, and happy. And we’ll see you in the cloud!

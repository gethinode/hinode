Some of you might still remember it as NorCal Dreamin’. Unlike events such as Dreamforce, Connections, TrailheaDX, and others, Tahoe Dreamin’ holds a distinct quality that sets it apart — it’s a true community gathering! Organized by trailblazers, for trailblazers, creating a one-of-a-kind experience.
Taking place on July 20th and 21st at the Harrah’s Convention Center — this in-person event helps us connect, build new relationships, and reconnect with others we haven’t seen in a while. Admins, Developers, Architects, Partners, Consultants, and Trailblazers are eager to share their experiences, while at the same time trying to discover and share innovations that can help them solve everyday tasks.
You’ll want to make sure to pick up your badge at the registration desk along with any goodies they have in store for attendees. Find out what breakout [sessions](https://tahoedreamin.com/2023-sessions/) you plan on attending while also considering some of their [workshops](https://tahoedreamin.com/2023-workshops/) (a new addition to the agenda). Be sure to visit the sponsors for additional perks they may have in store. Lastly, don’t forget to check out the happy hour networking session taking place Thursday the 20th!

## And Don’t Forget to Play Sponsor Bingo

For a second year, MK Partners and Tahoe Dreamin’ along with their sponsors come together to bring you another exciting activity (and a chance to to win some awesome prizes during this 2-day event). Last year it was done in a more traditional way where participants had to obtain actual stamps, complete their cards and turn them in. Well, this time around we want to save trees and create a better experience so we’ve decided to take things up a notch. QR codes will be placed around the venue to launch our friendly web app which you can go ahead and use to participate. Simply check off all the squares, complete your card, and be automatically entered into the raffle. Enjoy the chance to win some awesome prizes donated by your sponsors.

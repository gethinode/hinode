There are many benefits of using campaigns within your Org to help better collaborate with your peers. Improved tracking, reporting, customer insight, efficiency, and engagement to name a few. Campaigns help streamline marketing efforts to drive better results. Let’s take a look at how to create a campaign within the Lightning or Classic versions of Salesforce.

### Lightning Mode Instructions

Start by heading over to the **Campaigns** tab and clicking on the “New” button.

Give your campaign a name and provide additional traits to better classify its type. Useful characteristics consist of type, status, start date, end date, expected revenue, budget, and the actual cost to name a few. Make sure to save in order to create the campaign.

Once the campaign is created you will be taken to its campaign record.

Within each campaign record, you can upload attachments such as presentation decks, product or service specs, datasheets, etc. Easily create new contacts, opportunities, or cases linked to the campaign. Maintaining all information in one central location.

### Classic Mode Instructions

Switching over to classic instructions is somewhat similar but based on how each Org is configured may look a bit different along each step.
Heading over to the home screen you may or may not see the **Campaigns** tab. If it&#39;s not visible head over to the “+” to search it through all tabs.

Scroll down until you find **Campaigns** and click on it.

Now we&#39;re ready to create a campaign by clicking the “New” button.

Just as in Lightning mode, give your campaign a name and provide additional traits to better classify its type. Useful characteristics consist of type, status, start date, end date, expected revenue, budget, and the actual cost to name a few. Make sure to save in order to create the campaign.

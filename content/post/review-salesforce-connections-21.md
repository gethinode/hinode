Salesforce’s [Connections (virtual) conference](https://www.salesforce.com/connections/) was last week and, while there were some technical hiccups, the livestream did eventually get underway and viewers from all over the world were able to tune in to the keynote delivered from the top of Salesforce park and the sessions presented from all over the world!

Caylin and I attended, and then sat down to recap and review our experience at Salesforce Connections ‘21!

If you want to catch the (full) keynote or watch any of the awesome sessions too, you’re in luck! They’re all available for rewatch right [here](https://www.salesforce.com/connections/) — and you won’t have to worry about any of the issues that popped up while the event was live!

Drop your favorite sessions from the conference in the comments and stick around because the Salesforce event season is just warming up with TrailheaDX and Dreamforce quickly coming up on the horizon.

Until next time, keep working hard, smart, and happy. We’ll see you in the cloud.

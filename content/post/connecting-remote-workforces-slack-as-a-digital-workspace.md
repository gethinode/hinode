This includes, but isn’t limited to, their products, services, staff, operations and, most importantly, communication. Many businesses have several global office locations, while more still have dispersed remote workforces as a result of the pandemic. All of which requires them to take into consideration the legal and compliance requirements of each location, to comply with regulations — in addition to managing timezones, and maintaining cohesion and culture, even without regular face-to-face meetings.

Even before March 2020, companies have long sought ways to improve day-to-day operations and comms without the need to have everyone physically present. The digital era has blossomed during the past ten years but really transformed in the last few. While remote teams used to be the exception, they’re now the rule.

Zoom and Teams communication platforms led business adoption early on, but [Slack](https://slack.com/digital-hq) has changed the game offering organizations of all sizes a simple, seamless way build their “digital headquarters”. Somewhere colleagues can interact and work with others as if they were right next to each other. Something we’ve really seen takeoff with the introduction of Slack “Huddles” (instant conversation channels, spun up right from the sidebar for quick asks and speedy chats). On top of that, Slack’s continued integration with Salesforce is unifying teams, from sales and marketing, to finance, and legal — and instantly generating the relevant channels, messages, reminders, and alerts (as well as going the other way and populating data directly into Salesforce, without ever leaving the chat).

The ability to create spaces and connect systems together really reduces screen clutter, necessary clicks, and has the power to turn “should-have-been-an-email” meetings (and “should-have-been-an-instant-message” emails) into quick chats or a continuous, searchable, conversation.

They can be sorted by topic, discussion, product, service, etc…. they can be structured or informal — they can be whatever your team needs to succeed.. And, the ability to invite external users make it a powerful tool for connecting with clients (and sometimes prospects) as well!

And, with over 2500 applications and [integrations](https://slack.com/integrations) available, the Slack app directory allows you to further customize your instance. Pull up real-time customer information without having to leave and connect to other platforms. Customize workflows to define your unique processes and save time. And don’t forget to integrate your Salesforce org.

Even better, more features are being added as we speak! Always with the focus on bringing people closer together. It’s really amazing to see how Slack is revolutionizing and transforming the new world of digital workspaces!

As always, take care, and we’ll see you in the cloud. (And on Slack!)

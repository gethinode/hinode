One thing that makes goals easier to achieve, is a terrific support network of shared interests and endeavors, like the Trailblazer community!
Trailblazers create ways to help shape and impact those around them. That is why contests such as <strong>#mysalesforcegoals</strong> help bring the best out of everyone in the Salesforce communities from all over the world.
Let’s Learn More!

## What Was the Contest?

Instructions consisted of posting one word along with the reason for choosing that while at the same time using the hashtag on LinkedIn <strong>#mysalesforcegoals</strong>. Up to fifteen winners would be selected and given a free cert voucher for any Salesforce exam, while the most creative posts would receive a special Salesforce swag.
This simple yet effective campaign drew interest from various submissions across India, the US, the UK, Canada, and various other countries.
Both [Guilda H](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ghilaire/) and [Gaurav Kheterpal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gauravkheterpal/), well-known contributors to Salesforce helped put this together, once again this year, for the Trailblazer community.

Whether it’s to test out Salesforce features and functionality, teach yourself some new tricks, follow along with a Trailhead Trail, build a proof-of-concept for your company or client, test the waters as an admin or developer for your own organization, or any of a hundred other reasons — spinning up a developer org is a super useful ability to have.
And thankfully, Salesforce makes it easy!
In this video you can have your very own org up and running in 5-minutes! (Well, 6.25 minutes. But, if you skip the first minute and fifteen seconds by clicking here, get this page open in another tab , and then press play— boom, five minutes!). Enjoy!

Now you're all set to start setting up your org, objects, records, apps, automations, etc... however you want! In the next "How To" we'll talk setting up additional users, then branding and styling, and feel free to [let us know](http://www.twitter.com/mkpartners) your requests for future dev org "How To"s so we can add them to the schedule!

As always, if you have any questions or need a little more in-depth help in your production environment, [drop us a line](https://www.mkpartners.com/contact/)!

Until next time, keep working hard, smart, and happy --- and we'll see you in the cloud!

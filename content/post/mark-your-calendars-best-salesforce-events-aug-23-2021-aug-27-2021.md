Last week we had a Slack event thrown into the mix and this week I have Google events coming your way! So sit back, open up your calendars and get planning!

We are all aware of Salesforce certifications, but did you know there are Google certifications?? Google has been helping businesses and people for years gain skills in some shape or form and on Monday, August 23rd you will get that chance! At 8am (PST) [Grow you Cloud Literacy with the Google Cloud Digital Leader Certification](https://events.withgoogle.com/tech-grow-your-cloud-literacy-with-the-google-cloud-digital-leader-certification/registrations/rsvp/#current-step) will teach viewers how to prepare for this certification, including resources, how to utilize this certification, and who this certification is made for. The Cloud Digital Leader pathway is “designed to skill up business professionals who work with technical Google Cloud practitioners so that they can contribute to strategic technical decisions” and seeing that Salesforce works with Google products all of the time, it may be time for Salesforce Partners to get Google certs too!

The rest of the events for the week are occurring on Tuesday, August 24th, so the rest of your week will be boring — sorry. First off we have another Google event at 8am (PST) for the [AppSheet Technical Enablement Webinar](https://events.withgoogle.com/tech-appsheet-technical-enablement-webinar/registrations/rsvp/#current-step). During this webinar, viewers will learn how to create an AppSheet app from scratch for everyday scenarios. Not only is this a new resource, but viewers will gain experience needed to create a variety of apps for your customers! Developers I’m pretty sure this event is calling your name!

Then at 11am (PST) we have 2 different Salesforce events, so it’s time to be picky! Our first event, [Quick Tips for Safeguarding Your Business’s Data with Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/form/events/webinars/form-rss/3338963), is for small business owners who don’t have the luxury of an entire department monitoring cybersecurity. It’s easy for data security to take a back seat when small business owners are doing it all. And according to IT leaders, cybersecurity threats are just as important and dangerous as external threats, and seeing that more organizations are becoming more digitally savvy, it makes sense that businesses have a cybersecurity plan. Viewers will learn how Salesforce can help these businesses not only stop data breaches before they happen, but also meet compliance regulations.

Our second 11am (PST) event is [5 Ways to Make Territory Planning Easier this Season, featuring DocuSign](https://www.salesforce.com/form/events/webinars/form-rss/3308769) to integrate intelligent territory planning for maximizing revenue growth. You’ll hear about best practices for the territory planning cycle, and how Salesforce’s solutions help companies optimize coverage and realign when the conditions change. Additionally, you’ll hear from DocuSign on how they managed to carve out 3000 territories due to Salesforce.

## Recap

We kicked off last week celebrating Slack officially joining Salesforce in _Success from Anywhere: Your Digital HQ_ to hear how the two “are coming together to create your digital HQ for success from anywhere.” In _From Sourcing Practices to Legal Agreements: How to Drive Sustainability into Your Supply Chain_, we hear how to focus on data-driven climate action and how businesses can all achieve this on a scale that causes a positive impact. We had a unique Salesforce Trailhead Live webinar focusing on homelessness in _Homelessness: How Can You Help_ to shed light on the misunderstood and complex issue, and how government and nonprofits work together to solve this challenge. We ended with the monthly _The Marketing Cloud August 2021 New Feature Overview_ webinar that is always giving us updates about the new features and additions to products to Marketing Cloud. Tweet us [@mkpartners](http://www.twitter.com/mkpartners) and let us know what your favorite event was!

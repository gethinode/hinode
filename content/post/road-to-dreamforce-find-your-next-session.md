With less than a week before showtime, it’s time to start sorting out our Dreamforce schedules!
Thousands of sessions got submitted to the Dreamforce portal months prior to September, and most of them don’t make it past the first screening. Some get accepted, some get wait listed, and eventually, the winning picks are released by Role, Industry, Product, and Level!
With over forty thousand attendees headed to San Francisco next week, and a huge assortment of sessions to sift through, here’s our handy guide for making sure you don’t miss “sesh”es most relevant to you!

## Using Trail Maps

Instead of scrolling the Sessions Catalog, Dreamforce offers these [Trail Maps](https://www.salesforce.com/dreamforce/trail-maps/) which consist of curated sessions, speakers, and surprises you don’t want to miss out on. Based on your role, industry, or product these trails provide a unique learning experience, especially if you are new to the ecosystem.
Check them out and take a look at what might interest you.

## Use The Catalog, Find Your Sessions

Every year thousands of sessions are included as part of the three-day event and this year the “AI theme” is in full force which consists of close to 600 sessions and counting. Anticipate attendees overflowing them, as everyone is interested on how AI will be implemented into every product of the Salesforce ecosystem. It’s the beginning of a new era and with it a chance to get ahead of this “game-changing” technology that is going to revolutionize the way humans utilize technology moving forward.

While everyone has a personal interest in attending Dreamforce every year, many look to the [Sessions Catalog](https://reg.salesforce.com/flow/plus/df23/sessioncatalog/page/catalog) for desktop or mobile to map out an agenda and build a game plan.
As with previous years, the filters along with the search box make it a great combination to refine and locate sessions that interest you the most. With over three days of coverage and so many activities happening over the various venues having a plan will be a lifesaver and allow you to better experience the event without stressing about spending too much time looking for sessions to attend.
If you’ve been to Dreamforce then you’ll know that the streets, walkways, pavements, and even seating areas are going to make you feel like you are at Disneyland hoping from one line to the next. Plan ahead and identify when and where each of your sessions will be taking place.

## Some Helpful Tips

A few things we found out while checking out the website catalog included a new filter which is called <strong>Session Type</strong>. This allows you to quickly filter out sessions by either an Activity, Breakout, Campfire, Certification, Hands-on Workshop, Keynote, Roundtable, or Keynote.

This nice addition makes it easy and simple to find those sessions from key speakers, keynotes, and more. Locate those hands-on workshops and certifications that all Trailblazers are going to leverage while at Dreamforce. The lines were out the door last year and anticipate no difference this year as well.
The search box becomes extra handy to narrow and refine searches to see what some sessions have in common and distinguish them from each other. Search <strong>Available on Salesforce+</strong> to see what sessions are going to be available on the streaming platform for those of us who may not be able to attend this time around.

Once you decide and consider a session make sure to add it to your agenda which will include a date, time, and location. Use the handy map found within the <strong>Salesforce Events</strong> App, upon successfully registering, to help guide you.
This event will be jam-packed with various in-person guides, placed all around, which can help guide you in the right direction.

For those not able to make it check out [](https://www.salesforce.com/plus) for all their streaming coverage that will be taking place. We’re looking forward to all the excitement taking place during the livestreams.
Let us know what’s got you most excited and what you just can’t wait to see at [Dreamforce](http://www.dreamforce.com) this year. And until then, keep working hard, smart, and happy. And we’ll see you in the cloud!

We’re in the home stretch of the run-up to Summer ’23 and all those release notes, new features, functions, updates, and upgrades may have crammed our brains a bit — which makes this the perfect time for new (and experienced) Mambo Merge users to brush up on the basics, see a speedy demo of updated functionality, and get Qs to all their most pressing As! Tomorrow’s the next installment of [Mambo Merge ‘Office Hours](https://cloud.news.mambomerge.app/officehours)’!
It’s a chance to get a quick beginner’s intro to the app, get some experience building templates of your own, and to help shape future development and request the new features you’d like to see most!
The session is Thursday, June 8th at 10:00am (PT), and you can sign up [right here, right now](https://cloud.news.mambomerge.app/officehours)!

And, if you can’t make it, but still have a question (or have a complicated question that you think we might want some time to consider), go ahead and [toss it on the form here](https://forms.gle/xhg2uwkCjk5zmN1ZA) and we’ll be sure to address it on the call and email you back with the answer too (if you’d like)!
You’ll want to install [Mambo Merge](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxListingDetail?listingId=a0N3u00000MBinOEAT) ahead of time as well, so grab a free, up-to-date edition from the [AppExchange](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxListingDetail?listingId=a0N3u00000MBinOEAT) (or ask an admin to) and we’ll look forward to seeing you there!
Until then, keep working hard, smart, and happy. We’ll see you in the cloud.

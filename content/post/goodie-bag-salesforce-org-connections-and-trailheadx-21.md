[TrailheaDX](https://www.salesforce.com/trailheadx/) was [the year’s best Salesforce event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJXP-gy0qcY) yet — and it just got a little better with the arrival of the some sweet post-conference goodies! [Salesforce.org’s Connections ’21](https://www.salesforce.com/connections/) also followed up their look at how non-profits can improve their operations with technology with a “thank you” pack of their own!
It’s a good week to be in the Salesforce ecosystem, and Chris sat down to do another unboxing of the cool stuff that comes from participating in the Trailblazer community!

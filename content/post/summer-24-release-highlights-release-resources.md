The Summer ’24 Release has officially begun rolling out to orgs everywhere! Be sure you’re as up to date and ready as other Trailblazers by checking out all the release resources that Salesforce has to offer for Summer ‘24!
<strong>Note:</strong> Remember that not all features included on the release notes go live during the Release weekends so make sure to use the [Release Readiness Trailblazers](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/trailblazer-community/groups/0F9300000001okuCAA) group to stay up to date with community members’ latest findings and observations.

## Use The Maintenance Calendar (Trust | Status)

There is about a month stretch when most of the orgs get pushed the update, so make sure to stop by and check out [their calendar](https://status.salesforce.com/products/all/maintenances) to see when your org(s) will receive the updates. Make sure to traverse the list for your Salesforce instance which can be easily obtained by heading over Setup &gt; Company Settings &gt; Company Info within your org.

## Navigate The Release Site

This becomes the interactive [central hub](https://www.salesforce.com/products/summer-24-release/) just weeks after the Release Notes go live. If you need to trace back at some features, need more clarification, or simply want to send over your questions to the product managers to consider for the Readiness Release Live sessions, this is your one-stop place to find what you need, right after the Release Notes go live.

## Check Out The Product Demos

If you can’t find what you are looking for on the Release Site use these curated demos with helpful information based on the solution you seek. [Stream the playlist](https://www.salesforce.com/products/summer-24-release-all-demos/) to get you up to speed if you haven’t had time to read through some of the Release Notes. These Product Demos breakdown specifics on some of the new features headed your way.

## Use The Release In A Box (Downloadable PDF)

Visual learners rejoice and peruse a quick digest of the changes coming to an org near you! This [Release in a Box](https://www.salesforce.com/content/dam/web/en_us/www/documents/release-notes/summer24-release-in-a-box.pdf) is just the PDF you seek to summarize the most important changes coming to each of the Salesforce Product Lines. A high-level overview deck that is broken down with key highlights based on user types (Admin, Developer, etc.)

## Feature Matrix (Downloadable Excel)

This [handy Excel sheet](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/trailblazer-community/files/0694V00000Uhj4ZQAR?tab=overview) breaks down each feature released by user impact, availability, under review, pending, and more. Learn how Salesforce categorizes its features by product family, product, and sub-product. At the same time quickly identify what features require Admins to configure and set up for users.

## Release Module (Trailhead)

Enjoy learning and earning points within your Trailhead account after completing this [Trailmix](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/summer-24-release-highlights). A helpful resource to break down the upcoming changes into tidbit trails that are easier to process in your own time.

## Release Notes (If All Else Fails)

If you still need more clarification then head back to the raw notes. The one and only [Release Notes](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.salesforce_release_notes.htm&release=250&type=5) that everyone enjoys digging into as soon as they are available three times a year.

## Ready To Go Live?

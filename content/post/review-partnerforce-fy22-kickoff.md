Salesforce’s new fiscal year is underway and last week played host to the annual Partner Kickoff where consultants, implementers, and software vendors find out what to expect from the next 12 months in the ecosystem. Caylin and I tuned in live for the keynotes, special guests, seminars, and more and we reviewed and recapped it all on video!
If you’re a partner yourself, watch it for a quick recap of things you may have missed or, if you’re an organization that uses Salesforce, give it a watch to get some insight on other potential revenue streams for FY22 via the AppExchange!

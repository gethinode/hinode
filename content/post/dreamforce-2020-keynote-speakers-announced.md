The [Dreamforce 2020](https://www.salesforce.com/dreamforce/) keynote is less than two weeks away (with the rest of Dreamforce taking the form of DreamTX a couple weeks after that)! And today we got some insight on who we can expect to see speak on December 2nd!

{{< image src="/img/keynote-speakers.png" >}}

Event regulars Marc Benioff and Sarah Franklin will be joined by Salesforce's President & COO Bret Taylor, EVP Denise Dresser, and VP Leah McGowen-Hare as they discuss the difficult issues this year posed for businesses everywhere, how successful orgs adapted, how Salesforce responded and, as always, the most exciting new developments on the horizon!

We'll also hear unique customer stories from the CEOs of AT&T and Bentley Motors, as well as Gina M. Raimondo, the governor of Rhode Island! It should be interesting to hear about the effects of 2020 on public sector operations, especially with the sudden shift to remote work and the strain that was probably placed on a lot of agencies technical resources.

Ready to get some first-hand A.I. experience in Salesforce? Whether you’re curious about the capabilities of [Einstein](https://www.salesforce.com/products/platform/solutions/ai-services/), eager to get your feet wet harnessing artificial intelligence in an org, or just want to see a real world application of organizations that are using A.I. to improve their operations, you’re in luck!
Next Thursday, August 27th, I’ll be leading a hands on workshop where we’ll be walking through how a support department uses Einstein Prediction Builder to more accurately forecast which customers are likely to have an escalation so they can proactively improve their service, instead of waiting until things to go sideways.
Here are the details:
<strong>Hands on Workshop: Einstein Prediction Builder</strong><br>Date: Thursday, August 27th, 2020<br>Time: 11:00am — 12:00pm PDT<br>Where: Virtually!
[Register Here!](https://events.mkpartners.com/EinsteinWorkshop)
Attendees will be able to follow along in their own Einstein Scratch Org as we build a prediction, run it, and then evaluate its effectiveness — so it’s the perfect intro to inspire thinking about how A.I. could help your org operate more effectively, efficiently, and proactively, instead of reactively!
If you’ve ever been curious what Einstein looks like “under the hood” or what you need to develop your own A.I. solutions, you won’t want to miss it.
Workshop (virtual) seating will be limited so we’re able to give everyone the attention they need and make sure everyone’s able to follow along — so [sign up today](https://events.mkpartners.com/EinsteinWorkshop) to secure your spot and we’ll see you next week!
As always, if you’d like to have a more in-depth discussion about how Salesforce A.I. could be rolled out in your business, [drop us a line](https://www.mkpartners.com/contact/)! And until next week, keep working hard, smart, and happy.
We’ll see you in the cloud.

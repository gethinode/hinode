As 2020 pushed workplaces remote, the limits of some businesses' existing infrastructure have become painfully apparent. With tech debts being (proverbially) prematurely called for payment, and businesses of all sizes trying to navigate a shrunken economy, being able to operate remotely at full-strength (and ideally lowered costs) can make all the difference in the world.

One of the most powerful business tools to keep operations flowing smoothly is [GSuite](https://gsuite.google.com/landing/partners/referral/trial.html?utm_source=sign-up&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=apps-referral-program&utm_content=NANCUC3). Having email, Website, Messaging, Video Conferencing, Document Generation, Storage, and more --- all in one cloud platform has made it a boon to businesses, even before workplace logistics shifted this year.

And, in response to the pandemic, Google's given partners like us another way to help businesses dealing with everything: promo codes for 20% an initial year of GSuite --- to help keep organizations functioning at full-strength.

If you're interested in GSuite for your business, you can start a 2-week free trial [right here](https://gsuite.google.com/landing/partners/referral/trial.html?utm_source=sign-up&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=apps-referral-program&utm_content=NANCUC3) and, if you'd like to get 20% off your first year, just [fill out this form](https://news.mkpartners.com/GSuitePromoCode) and we'll email you one of the promo codes!

As always, if you need help with implementation, configuration, or migration (or just want a more in-depth chat about how GSuite would fit in your business processes)--- [drop us a line](https://www.mkpartners.com/contact/)! We're happy to help.

And until next time, keep working hard, smart, and happy. We'll see you in the cloud.

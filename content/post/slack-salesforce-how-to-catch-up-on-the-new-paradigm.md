The biggest news out of Dreamforce last year was Salesforce’s acquisition of Slack — this week, [it became official](https://www.salesforce.com/news/press-releases/2021/07/21/salesforce-slack-deal-close/)! And while most of us are familiar with the communication platform, surprisingly there’s only a 5% overlap between organizations that use both Salesforce and Slack in their day-to-day operations.
Obviously, Salesforce is going to be looking to change that so, along with keeping our eyes peeled for sweetheart deals to woo users from one platform to both, it’s also an important time to brush up on your Slack knowledge and get a sense of how the platforms can combine to further revolutionize the way business gets done.
From new opportunities for [app development](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/slack-app-development-with-bolt?trailmix_creator_id=cstegall&trailmix_slug=slack-for-salesforce-users) to improved communication and satisfaction internally or in [sales](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/slack-first-sales?trailmix_creator_id=cstegall&trailmix_slug=slack-for-salesforce-users), [marketing](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/slack-first-marketing?trailmix_creator_id=cstegall&trailmix_slug=slack-for-salesforce-users), and [support](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/slack-first-service?trailmix_creator_id=cstegall&trailmix_slug=slack-for-salesforce-users) efforts — the addition of Slack to the Salesforce stable is going to be a huge asset to delivering the data-driven, Customer-360 experience that’s made Salesforce the world’s leading CRM.
And they’re making it easy to brush up on your knowledge and start “thinking in Slack” in order to help you recognize all the potential value of integrating the platforms into your org’s regular processes with a handful of helpful Trailhead lessons!

Our first community event of 2023 is just around the horizon, so make sure you have registered, packed your bags, and laced up some comfortable shoes as will give you a quick rundown of what to expect. This journey takes us over to the city of Phoenix, AZ where will explore the <strong>Events On Jackson</strong> center located at 245 E Jackson, Phoenix, AZ 86004. Here, [Cactusforce](https://www.cactusforce.com/) will take place on Jan 19th and 20th. This in-person (with a virtual component) event as stated on their website focuses on advanced content for developers, architects, and configurators (a.k.a., Admins). Connect with fellow Trailblazers and explore the Jackson centers’ main rooms, workshops, and mini-rooms to curate all that technical and professional content that is in store for all attendees.
Make sure to check out all the sponsor booths (physically and virtually) to pay tribute to those who contributed to this event. Make sure to pick up your badge at the front registration along with any goodies they have available for attendees. Find out what breakout sessions you plan on adding to your agenda and don’t forget to check out the demo jam. The agenda with full details for both days can be seen[ here](https://www.cactusforce.com/2023-sessions).
This year Cactusforce will be utilizing the popular [Whova](https://whova.com/) app. A helpful resource that brings together all event information within one central location. Once registered for the event download the app and log in using your registration email. From agenda, attendees, community messages, photos, sponsor booths, and more Whova compiles all the essential information you seek to improve the event experience.

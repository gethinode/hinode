Wow this week I’m a little shook cause I don’t have a single Trailhead community group event! Also, I hope your calendars are cleared for Tuesday and Thursday cause there is a lot going on during those days. So sit back, open up your calendar and let’s get planning!
Once again we are kicking off the week on the other side of the pond in the UK! [](https://www.salesforce.com/uk/events/salesforce-live-uki/) are going to be showcasing all of their top Trailblazers and demonstrating how they are planning for the future. The event starts on Tuesday, October 13th 10am (BST), so that’s really early for us in the states. The event is a few hours long and has lots of session options. These sessions contain in depth learning and product demonstrations. There are over 30 guest speakers so RSVP ASAP.
For those of us not willing to get up THAT early, we have the [](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/live/broadcasts/a2r3k000001n29k/trailblazer-talk-show) to ease us into the morning. At 9am (PDT) this week is focusing on guest speakers from PagerDuty who went from novice to expert in the Salesforce world. I know this isn’t necessarily an event, especially when compared to the event above, but it’s still inspiring!
Then at 10am (PDT) [](https://www.salesforce.com/form/events/webinars/form-rss/2731256) is teaching you how to use Einstein. The purpose of AI is to help you adapt (hi Pandemic) and scale so that you can focus on your business being more relevant for your customers. If you want to learn how to increase productivity, use bots to improve customer experience and learn more about your customers past experiences to increase customer satisfaction, then you need to sign up!
For our only Wednesday event, we have a representative from Verizon discussing how they use Salesforce in [](https://www.salesforce.com/form/events/webinars/form-rss/2665177) at 11am (PDT). Due to a vast majority of people having to work from home or staying at home, getting reliable internet access is more important than ever. Verizon will be speaking to viewers about how they are using their data to address business problems, utilize Tableau dashboards, and responding to COVID-19 all to improve their customer experience.
Okay, small businesses this one’s for you! On Thursday, October 15th at 9am (PDT) [](https://www.salesforce.com/form/events/webinars/form-rss/2649441) is going to cover navigating the future of marketing and how to get ahead. The speaker will be discussing how customers needs are changing and how you can adjust your marketing strategy, and how to scale the market to meet these demands in a digital world. He will be using examples from other companies who have evolved their marketing strategies and benefited from this evolution.
Also at 9am (PDT) this is an event that I personally will be attending! As the Event and Volunteer Coordinator for MK Partners, we haven’t been able to volunteer in person since February. The Volunteer in the New Digital Age is joining Salesforce and NAACP to [discuss how technology has changed the relationship between volunteers and nonprofits](https://www.salesforce.com/form/sfdo/ngo/volunteer-in-the-new-digital-age/). They will also be talking about new roles and opportunities that do exist for those who want to get involved.
Ending this week at 11am (PDT) [](https://www.salesforce.com/form/events/webinars/form-rss/2706037) is here for your sales team! Due to the pandemic territory planning has required adjustments. Both PagerDuty and Salesforce will show how they begin with segmentation to align the business goals and territory, approach the planning through the Center of Excellence and integrate technology to crave and deploy territories.

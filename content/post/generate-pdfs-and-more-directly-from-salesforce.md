Generating documents straight from Salesforce is one of the most powerful ways to transform your data into time-savings for your team — that’s why we built [Mambo Merge](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxListingDetail?listingId=a0N3u00000MBinOEAT). And Mambo Merge just rolled out some brand new, much-asked-for functionality — the ability to generate PDFs, directly from your data!

We’ll be doing a demo tomorrow at our monthly [Mambo Merge Office Hours](https://events.mkpartners.com/MamboMergeOfficeHours), so be sure to sign up and tune in for that.

It’s a chance to get a speedy beginner’s intro to the app, get some experience building templates of your own, and to help shape future development and request the new features you’d like to see most! (In fact, the PDF functionality is a direct result of requests from these sessions).

The next session is tomorrow, July 8th at 10:30am (PT), and you can sign up [right here, right now](https://events.mkpartners.com/MamboMergeOfficeHours)!

You’ll want to install [Mambo Merge](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxListingDetail?listingId=a0N3u00000MBinOEAT) ahead of time as well, so grab a free, up-to-date edition from the [AppExchange](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxListingDetail?listingId=a0N3u00000MBinOEAT) (or ask an admin to) and we’ll look forward to seeing you there!

Until then, keep working hard, smart, and happy. We’ll see you in the cloud.

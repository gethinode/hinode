February plays host to a significant Salesforce event in terms of its impact on the platform, implementations, and support — but one that also tends to slip by a little bit under the radar: Partnerforce!
As Salesforce steps into their new fiscal year, Partnerforce offers a unique opportunity to get some inside info into what to expect from the platform over the next 12 months and provides a ton of avenues for feedback, support, and to help shape the Salesforce ecosystem to better serve our clients.
The event itself tends to sneak by if you’re not a Salesforce partner, but the effects and outcomes will be reflected all year long in improved client service, increased flexibility in the platform, and the removal of bottlenecks and obstacles on organizations paths to success in the cloud ecosystem.
Caylin sat down to walk us through what to expect, and how to enroll!

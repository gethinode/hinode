There’s nothing else that delivers that specific, crushing, disheartening feeling like losing something you’ve worked on and having to start over from scratch. And, when it comes to your business data, systems and relationships developed over years — a data loss can bring the entire operation to a grinding halt.

As the developers of Salesforce’s [Undo Button](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/listingDetail?listingId=a0N30000000qDc0EAE), we‘re no stranger to frantic calls from organizations desperate to revert to a “safe” state after a data-snafu. And while Undo Button makes it easy to “wind back the clock” to undo any org-breaking errors, there is one requirement: it has to be installed before you have a problem.

Which brings us to today’s post — when is the “right” time to backup your data.

### Planting a Tree

Any arborist will tell you, “The best time to plant a tree is twenty years ago. The second best time is now.” and the same principle applies to securing your data. In most cases, waiting until you have a problem means it’s already too late. Which makes sense, it’s hard to roll back if you don’t have any record of what you’re trying to roll back to. Backing up data is about foresight, preparedness, and staying ahead of the potential for things to go wrong.

The short answer then is, now. Now is the best time to backup your data. Right now. Like, stop reading and do something about it, now.

There are a ton of solutions on the [AppExchange](http://appexchange.salesforce.com/) and, while [Undo Button](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxListingDetail?listingId=a0N30000000qDc0EAE) offers a little different functionality in terms of data retention (like undoing accidental or malicious user actions), it also empowers you to revert to your previous, functional state in case of emergency.

Because while the worst part of those calls, from orgs in the middle of a crisis, is letting them know that they can’t just install the app now and flash things back to normal, the bright spot is helping them install it today and ensuring they’ll never be in this situation again.

So seriously. Don’t wait until there’s an issue. Don’t put this on the calendar for next week’s tech call. Do something today. Now. Put the tools in place to save your future self the stress. No one ever regretted rolling out an effective backup strategy and then not using it.

And, until next time, keep working hard, smart, and happy. We’ll see you in the cloud.

Trained eyes will have noticed some cool changes to the [AppExchange](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxConsultingListingDetail?listingId=a0N30000001gF9jEAE) in the last week --- especially when it comes to finding the right Salesforce partner. Alongside more granular filtering options and the freshly released "consultant finder" wizard, the most helpful and exciting update seems to be new Partner Navigator Achievements that are now reflected on the Expertise tab!

Generated by Salesforce based on a partner’s successfully completed projects, it’s now possible to drill down into a firm’s expertise on a product or industry-specific basis — and find the match that’s right for you and your org.

And now that they’re live, we’re proud to be recognized as experts by Salesforce for our work in the public sector! Working with the federal government, states, cities, and counties is a different world than private-org projects — with government-specific requirements, regulations, org structures, and sometimes even mandated project methodologies. It’s a world we’ve now become experts at navigating smoothly and so we’re excited to see that commitment to excellence recognized by Salesforce. (Procurement departments will also probably be excited about having one more tangible screening tool for crafting their next Salesforce project RFP.)

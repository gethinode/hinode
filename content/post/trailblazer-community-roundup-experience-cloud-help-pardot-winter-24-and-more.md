As [Dreamforce ](https://dreamforce.com/)shrinks in our rear view mirrors, the [Winter ’24 Release](https://medium.com/creme-de-la-crm/releasehighlights/home) rises over the horizon, and (what feels like) the world’s fastest year avalanches into Q4, the ever-helpful [Trailblazer Community](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/trailblazer-community/groups?tab=featured) is abuzz with opportunities for skill development, release preparation, accomplishment celebration, and more!
In today’s installment of the Trailblazer Community Roundup, we’ve gathered up some of this week’s most exciting updates so you don’t have to worry about anything slipping through the cracks as we head into spooky season! Let’s dive in!

## Experience Cloud Technical Office Hours

Got a question, obstacle, or hang-up of a more technical nature on the Experience Cloud side of things? (Community Cloud for those of us that still call it Candlestick Park).
Tomorrow at 9am PST, join Salesforce for their Experience Cloud Technical Q&amp;A Office Hours to “ask any questions that you have (including no-code, low-code, and pro-code). [They’ll] have a panel of experts answer customer and partner questions about Experience Cloud development and attempt to demystify some of the technically challenging areas of the platform”.
You can [register right here](https://salesforce.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_bzqDSajMQ227w7bTa_-n1A#/registration) and, if you really want to make sure you get your Q A’d, you can submit your questions ahead of time to be given priority!

## Release Readiness Live: Winter ’24

{{< image src="/img/1_MOnEApSimfq9xRWq9Yom7Q.png" title="Image" >}}

The word “live” has a lot of meanings, and we’re using a bunch on this one! [Release Readiness Live: Winter ’24](https://www.salesforce.com/plus/experience/release_readiness_live?_gl=1*1ynzfog*_ga*MzYzNjQ5NDYuMTY5NTgzNzg2OQ..*_ga_H6M98GGB18*MTY5NjM2NzM5Ny4xLjEuMTY5NjM2NzU3MC4wLjAuMA..*_gcl_au*OTQzMDYyMDg5LjE2OTU4MzgzMDE.&_ga=2.72890001.367268812.1696367398-36364946.1695837869) is live on [Salesforce+](https://www.salesforce.com/plus/experience/release_readiness_live?_gl=1*1ynzfog*_ga*MzYzNjQ5NDYuMTY5NTgzNzg2OQ..*_ga_H6M98GGB18*MTY5NjM2NzM5Ny4xLjEuMTY5NjM2NzU3MC4wLjAuMA..*_gcl_au*OTQzMDYyMDg5LjE2OTU4MzgzMDE.&_ga=2.72890001.367268812.1696367398-36364946.1695837869), that is to say a recording of it is live. It was broadcast live, when it was recorded, and now that recording is live, on the site, ready to be watched on demand! So, experts and Trailblazers are no longer in the studio, but you can watch a replay of when they were and prep for the Winter ’24 Release!
See them answer questions, demo features, and take the opportunity to Learn, Connect, Grow, and Innovate on your way to Salesforce’s latest release.

## Pardot Demo Orgs

Ever wanted to try out “B2B Marketing on the World’s #1 CRM”? Well you’re in luck because you can hop into a [sample/demo org](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/promo/orgs/pardot-de) and give it a spin! I still need to give it a full run through to find out where the functionality limits are (I imagine you can’t actually send a mass email to 10,000 contacts), but if you’ve been curious about Engagement Studio, what’s possible with Completion Actions, building Pardot Landing Pages, or prepping for a Pardot certification, it’ll be a [great place to start](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/promo/orgs/pardot-de)!
{{< image src="/img/1_JNFhlLnc_V_hiXJJD04bqw.png" title="Image" >}}

Eagle-eyed viewers will have noticed that I’m not saying “Marketing Cloud Account Engagement”, Pardot’s new name as of last year. I know, I know, bad habit BUT, in my defense, the [landing page here](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/promo/orgs/pardot-de) still says Pardot, so I think it’s ok… for now :).

## Weekly Answer Leader:

Salesforce is celebrating this week’s answer leader: [Max Mlinarić-Subotec](https://trailblazers.salesforce.com/profileView?u=0054S000000khsDQAQ)!

Summer seemed to creep in a bit more slowly this year while we're all cooped up in quarantine, but the rising temperatures, late sunsets, and last weekend's annual cacophony of aerial explosions can only mean one thing --- Summer's officially here and that means the [Salesforce Summer '20 Release](https://releasenotes.docs.salesforce.com/en-us/summer20/release-notes/salesforce_release_notes.htm) is right around the corner!

And that also means it's time again for us to review the release notes, test things out in our preview orgs, and then share which new features, updates, and upgrades we're most excited about.

Today, we're taking a look at the new and improved [Opportunity Splits](https://releasenotes.docs.salesforce.com/en-us/summer20/release-notes/rn_sales_opportunity_splits_limit.htm)!

### What are Opportunity Splits

For the uninitiated, opp splits allow you to accurately divvy up opportunity revenue to the relevant team members that contributed to its closing. So, let's say you have a sales rep and a tech team up to do a pitch and a demo for a prospective client. If they're each entitled to a commission on the closed deal, or they each get measured on their activities-to-revenue won, with opp splits you can give them each "credit" for their contribution to the deal and split up the revenue, commissions, glory etc.. appropriately!

### So What's Changing?

Opportunity Splits are a crucial component of most complex sales structures, and with the Summer '20 Release Salesforce is giving them even more flexibility.

While orgs were previously limited to just three custom splits, the new release bumps that number up to six, in addition to the default revenue and overlay splits built into Salesforce!

What that means for admins and execs is even more granularity and accuracy is possible when matching your existing sales processes to your Salesforce instance. No more extra-org, excel driven commission sheets, no more sales journals to "more accurately" track efforts, and no more "fake opportunities" to "balance out" the total contract amount with every member of the team's professional involvement (<-please, please don't do this).

And, because it's Salesforce, if it's in the org, you can report on it --- meaning that improved opportunity splits also make for more accurate reports and dashboards, better insight into pipeline movement and potential, and a clearer picture of exactly where your team's efforts make the most impact.

You can find the release notes for the Opportunity Splits improvements [right here](https://releasenotes.docs.salesforce.com/en-us/summer20/release-notes/rn_sales_opportunity_splits_limit.htm) and, if you have any questions about how your org could employ them to improve your data, [drop us a line](https://www.mkpartners.com/contact/)! We're always happy to help.

The Summer '20 release hits orgs on July 17th, so stay tuned here to read up on the rest of our favorite soon-to-be features and, as always, keep working hard, smart, and happy.

We'll see you in the cloud.

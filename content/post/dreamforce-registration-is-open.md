It’s officially time to start thinking about Dreamforce! The next one. Dreamforce ’24.
Yeah, already.
DF24 tickets are officially up and [registration is open](https://www.salesforce.com/dreamforce/register/)!
If you [took the opportunity to get on the pre-reg list](https://cremedelacrm.com/post/last-chance-lock-in-300-off-dreamforce-this-year/), check your inbox for your promo code that’ll knock $1200 of regular registration price, and $300 off the early bird rate!

And, if you didn’t get that email (which seems to be a fairly common experience currently) — reach outto Salesforce and they’ve been providing them to folks that never got their expected send!
Otherwise, you’ll want to act fast to lock in the [Early Bird rate](https://www.salesforce.com/dreamforce/register/) which will still save you $500 over the regular price (just don’t forget to also factor in hotel, travel, etc… when you’re budgeting your Dreamforce).

## Artificial Intelligence

This year, AI will again be taking center stage as Salesforce bills DF24 “The most trusted AI event in the world”, promising to help “Prepare [Trailblazers] for the biggest shift in technology in our time”.

## Learning And Professional Development

Dreamforce ’24 will be offering a typically star-studded speaker list featuring experts, icons, and the uniquely insightful on the keynote main stage.

This year’s Dreamforce will also feature:
More than 115 visionary speakers
More than 1.5 thousand learning sessions
More than 11 thousand product experts
With predicted attendees from a whopping 143 countries!

## ROI

And, of course, Salesforce has almost perfected the process of ensuring you and your organization get your money’s worth by providing a wealth of opportunities for attendees to become more productive, effective, and innovative. And they’ll help you [write your boss a letter](https://static.rainfocus.com/plus/df23/static/staticfile/staticfile/Dreamforce%202024%20Convince%20Your%20Boss%20Letter_1713819682280001qcJk.pdf) to prove it!

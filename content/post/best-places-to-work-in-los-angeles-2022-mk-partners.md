It feels like just yesterday that we were celebrating our back-to-back annual achievement being certified a Great Place to Work, and now we’re proud to announce that MK Partners has officially been recognized ([again](https://labusinessjournal.com/bptw2021/)!) by the LA Business Journal as one of the [Best Places to Work in Los Angeles](https://labusinessjournal.com/bptw2021/) for the second year in a row!

Of the more than 250,000 companies in Los Angeles County, we’re so proud to have made the top 100 — and we couldn’t do it without the tremendous effort, camaraderie, and collaboration that every member of our team brings to the table.

The list is the result of a free, rigorous, anonymous survey process — where staffs all over LA are polled on their benefits, company culture, management, communication, etc… and selection means we’re all on the same page about enjoying the work we do everyday!

Thursday, August 11th the LABJ will be [hosting an award show](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/best-places-to-work-awards-2022-tickets-378038341857) to announce the final rankings and reveal which organization is LA’s number 1 best place to work! A change from last year’s virtual session, we’ll be eagerly awaiting to see if we improved on last year’s #16 spot! The show itself usually also offers invaluable insight into what other companies are doing in terms of flexibility, benefits, and more to make themselves great places to work.

Thanks again to every member of the MK Partners team for making this such a wonderful place to work and, if you’re looking to join our team yourself, [drop us a line](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxConsultingListingDetail?listingId=a0N30000001gF9jEAE&utm_source=mkp&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=logigear-mkp-tpp)!

Until next time, keep working hard, smart, and happy. We’ll see you in the cloud.

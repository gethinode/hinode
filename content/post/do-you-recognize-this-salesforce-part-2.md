We’re back with Part 2 of our look at how the homepage of the world’s leading CRM has changed over the years — like clicking through the years on Google Maps to see what’s become of your childhood home!
Thanks to the internet archive, we’ve got a time capsule of the impacts product releases, acquisitions, UX overhauls, the invention of the iPhone, and more have had on [www.salesforce.com](http://www.salesforce.com./) and today we’re taking a look at 2006–2010!
Let’s dive in!

## 2006

{{< image src="/img/1_wsekbA_ZkNZwXyTDDLnxJw.png" title="Image" >}}

We’re still seeing the spectres of Flash elements lost to time or rendered unrenderable by security advancements, web best practices, and a more modern commitment to accessibility — but 2006’s homepage has some exciting developments!
Along with a continuation of the trend that’s seen more and more text and content beginning to populate the homepage, we also have our first official AppExchange callout!
{{< image src="/img/1_epe71hHp4m5vhp7NvOTQMw.png" title="Image" >}}

And it’s already hosting more 280 apps!
{{< image src="/img/1__dwIMkhJr_t_hwhyqShWeg.png" title="Image" >}}

An incredible number for the time, but a ghost town cvompared to today’s 7000+ apps!

## 2007

{{< image src="/img/1_dTctuwib0SzdblTMOOPUMw.png" title="Image" >}}

{{< image src="/img/1_N3QJ15zmskyhhDDm1YAH_w.png" title="Image" >}}

2007 and we’ve got functioning (archived) homepage banners AND our first Dreamforce mention! That year San Francisco would play host to the Trailblazer Community from September 16th to 19th.
{{< image src="/img/1_z4QX4FwxMtdIth1bBqhyZw.png" title="Image" >}}

We’ve also got a new, low (advertised) price of $10/user/month, 575+ apps on the AppExchange (more than doubled in a year) and…
{{< image src="/img/1_iud9IPcHaYdUuvYq5KbMPQ.png" title="Image" >}}

…our first Apex call out!
{{< image src="/img/1_LCFdrftl9VCExptt_Ay8OQ.png" title="Image" >}}

And a collaboration between two of today’s most dominant companies in the tech space!

## 2008

{{< image src="/img/1_2d1AbtKF4nRkOQQxp6J_LQ.png" title="Image" >}}

{{< image src="/img/1_ElZR3kOiBxCUxCARomqb_g.png" title="Image" >}}

2008, unfortunately, has the return of the un-archived or unrenderable Flash elements but(!) we also have a price drop, hundreds more AppExchange apps (up to 800 now!), 10,000+ new customers, and 1 additional language added!
{{< image src="/img/1_tRdspOLZKRvlsOeECehC8A.png" title="Image" >}}

2008 also has some of our first homepage pitches of the platform as a service and the advent of Force.com!
{{< image src="/img/1_qjHgeeCTL5J1RZHyt0ynxw.png" title="Image" >}}

{{< image src="/img/1_AcvCWEL_Sj_Tbr9IgCQoTQ.png" title="Image" >}}

And, perhaps most exciting — the introduction (and immediate ubiquity) of the iPhone gave rise to Salesforce Mobile for the iPhone!
{{< image src="/img/1_Vy_0eddPmM5yBkmO2877rA.png" title="Image" >}}

A cozy tie in to the fact that Marc Benioff gave Steve Jobs the “App Store” name and rebranded Salesforce’s app marketplace as the AppExchange.
{{< image src="/img/1_SVhdYMHvPF7PY_F0SAZ0_Q.png" title="Image" >}}

And how could I not mention the Salesforce for Dummies shoutout (and offer!) — one of the platform’s first widespread public guides and written by [Matt Kaufman](https://www.salesforce.com/trailblazer/the1mattkaufman) who’s still Trailblazing today (we just saw him speak at TDX)!

## 2009

{{< image src="/img/1_tUEH1h2q6fnOJnlZLBwi_g.png" title="Image" >}}

{{< image src="/img/1_quD6eO7pt23aEo9YDn5loQ.png" title="Image" >}}

The last year of the aughts, naughts, two-thousands, whatever you call them, 2009’s homepage suffers from some rendering issues that persist for several of the snapshots for the year on the internet archive but what does render is our first real shift to the modern “Cloud” suffix naming convention!
{{< image src="/img/1_TZ_X4nwSiXvl3p4iviXFDA.png" title="Image" >}}

By this point Salesforce has also catapulted to 1.5M+ succesful engagements and, while the page itself has become much “cleaner” and more modern in its embrace of negative space — they chose to devote a large chunk to really reiterating what CRM is and what Salesforce does.
{{< image src="/img/1_ertp_XQv7LJnnIx7_a_Rog.png" title="Image" >}}

A blurb I think I’ll start sending to relatives who ask what exactly I do nowadays.

## 2010

{{< image src="/img/1_46jVp2Wf6Uyb6ES3vul_vA.png" title="Image" >}}

{{< image src="/img/1_gi_p_K9LRNjiHUIxBlOD8A.png" title="Image" >}}

We’ve got cloud! The familiar asymmetric cloud that’s said “Salesforce” for the last 15 years has officially made an appearance by 2010!
{{< image src="/img/1_JLmHd7QQcWuZ9MAJMcWIwQ.png" title="Image" >}}

And it’s already being put to use linking the Salesforce brand with its big name clients (like 2010 Starbucks!) thanks to some graphic design/branding we still see the platform employ today!
{{< image src="/img/1_C13j51asLSnoZBJDut0ryQ.png" title="Image" >}}

2010’s site also celebrates the launch of Chatter!
{{< image src="/img/1_g9NcFSHHuqwWuU90eKwKOA.png" title="Image" >}}

And in a move that, in hindsight, kind of perfectly encapsulates the energy of 2010 and the sequel-heavy-box-office-summer we have callouts for Sales Cloud 2 and Service Cloud 2! (Rejected titles included: **Sales Cloud 2: Sell Harder **and **2 Service 2 Cloud).**

And with that we also get the more formal rollout of Customer Success Stories and a public-facing presentation of account size and industry-specific marketing!
{{< image src="/img/1_05hNf7q9BQtGUsGO3C324A.png" title="Image" >}}

A strategy that would prove succesful and remains in place to this day!

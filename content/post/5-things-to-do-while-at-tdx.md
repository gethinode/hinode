We are only days away from TrailblazerDX and people from all parts of the world will be arriving in the Bay Area. Expect delays to get a cup of coffee or even find an Uber to get you to and from the airport. While you worry about how to maneuver the ins and outs of the city. Let us help you by consolidating some things to add to your to-do list.

## Attend Happy Hour Events (Various Throughout Each Day)

Many sponsors or collaborators will put together networking activities such as happy hours to bring Trailblazers together. There will be many happening at once so choose which ones fit your schedule after each day. One of the recommendations will be to check out SF Ben Happy Hour.
If you work with Salesforce then chances are you stopped by their site and found some helpful articles to use for your everyday tasks. Expect an open bar, and perhaps a fun activity or two, as they anticipate another successful activity.

## Visit The Salesforce Tower

Known as the 8th Wonder (Not really, but still an amazing experience if you get the chance) the Salesforce Tower lives at the heart of San Francisco and is just a bit taller than the Eiffel Tower. A must-experience site if you haven’t had the chance.

## Walk The Golden Gate Bridge

Visiting the world-famous Golden Gate Bridge is a unique experience for everyone. Whether you hike, walk, bike, shop, take a guided tour, or just sit back and take it all in, there is something for everyone.

## Enjoy The TDX Experience

Don’t lose sight and enjoy the moment. Whether it&#39;s taking a picture with your favorite Salesforce character or meeting up with a Trailblazer to have a cup of coffee. Living the experience and taking it all in is what these events are all about. Don’t lose sight of your goals but at the same time have some fun.

## Conclusion

These are just some of the activities we recommend for first-timers or returning visitors to the Bay Area. Let us know what are you looking forward to the most while attending TDX this year.
Until then, keep working hard, smart, and happy. We’ll see you in the cloud.

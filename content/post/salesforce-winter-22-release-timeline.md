The hot Summer weather might not show it, but the Salesforce Winter ’22 release is already on the horizon! As always, we’ll be peppering the lead-up to launch with another round of [Release Highlights](https://medium.com/creme-de-la-crm/tagged/release-highlights) posts to show-off our picks for the most-anticipated updates, upgrades, and new features, and today we’ll be talking through the timeline so you can be sure to not miss a thing in this release cycle.
Let’s dive in!

## Sandbox Cut-Off Date — Today, August 25th

Today’s the last day to ensure you have a sandbox set up on a preview instance if you want to get a sneak peek at Winter ’22 before it goes live worldwide! Well, technically Salesforce says you just have to have it done before August 26th, but we read that as “today” just to be safe.
If you need a refresher on how to check if your sandbox is in a preview instance, or how to make the update so you get early access you can check out our [previous post right here](https://medium.com/creme-de-la-crm/new-release-test-drive-the-winter-20-sandbox-preview-3d35c39c95c4) and head over to [Salesforce help](https://www.salesforce.com/blog/winter-22-sandbox-preview/#:~:text=sandbox%20preview%20instructions) where they have a handy write-up as well!

## Sandbox Previews Go Live — August 27 &amp; 28

If you’re taking advantage of the sandbox preview, Friday and Saturday will be the days the updates occur, so first thing Monday morning you’ll be able to take all the new features for a test spin! Sandbox previews are our greatest source of accurately evaluating just how valuable individual updates are going to be to our org, and our clients’ orgs, so it’s definitely worth the time if you get the chance.

## Release Site Goes Live — August 27

The [release notes are already live](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_ru.htm&type=5&release=234), but what if you’re looking for a Trailhead module to walk you through the release in a clear, digestible, slightly-gamified way? Well Friday also marks the launch of the release readiness website with short videos, helpful demos, and a whole module designed to impart the most knowledge with the least amount of friction, whatever your preferred learning style!

## Winter ’22 Go Live

And finally, the main event! When can you expect Winter ’22 to be live in your production environment. It depends a bit on your org ID, but the release is being broken out into 3 main sweeps, a super-limited pilot program first, and then two much wider releases before it’s in orgs everywhere:
**September 10 — First Release Weekend (Limited, Pilot participation)**
**October 1 — Second Release Weekend**
**October 8–9 — Final Release Weekend**
Be sure to review [our guide](https://medium.com/creme-de-la-crm/how-to-check-when-the-spring-21-release-is-hitting-your-org-5167b887c1b6) on how to check exactly when you can expect the update on your end and, as always, the complete list of orgs, updates, and timelines is available on the [Salesforce Trust page](https://www.salesforce.com/blog/winter-22-sandbox-preview/#:~:text=gets%20upgraded.%20Our-,Trust,-page%20has%20the)!
As always, we’ll be doing another round of [Release Highlights](https://medium.com/creme-de-la-crm/tagged/release-highlights) posts and videos as we countdown to launch, so stay tuned for our picks for favorite new features and, if you have any of your own, feel free to drop them in the comments.
Until then, keep working hard, smart, and happy. We’ll see you in the cloud.

For the 25 years that Salesforce has existed, one thing has always been true: the platform’s only as effective as its data. Adoption is at the core of an organization’s Salesforce success and admins know that removing obstacles to record creation, editing, or updating are keys to ensuring the platform gets used by those for whom its built.
Because let’s face it — your sales team wasn’t hired for their data entry skills, but because they’re great at sourcing, building, and closing deals. Same goes for your service department (but solving client issues, instead of selling), accounting (but with money math), etc…! So anything you can do to ensure that data makes its way into your org, without putting the burden on your colleagues is a win (especially when they‘ve already entered it elsewhere. After all, double-data-entry is the number one cause of system abandonment worldwide!).
That’s why this Summer ’24 feature is sure to a C-Suite (and Admin) Fave!

## Create Contacts Automatically from Email and Calendar Interactions

The retirement of [Salesforce Inbox](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_sales_inbox1.htm&language=en_US&release=250&type=5) and [Salesforce for Outlook](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_sales_sfo.htm&release=250&type=5) won’t mean the end of email integration — in fact, it’s getting even better with Summer ‘24! Starting with this release, you’ll “Never create a contact from scratch again” because you’ll be able to have them [automatically generated by your email and calendar activity](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_sales_feature_core_contacts_autocreation.htm&release=250&type=5)!
And, you’ll have the flexibility to set your own thresholds so you don’t clutter up your org with randos. You’ll be able to “set a threshold to create or suggest contacts after they’re mentioned in your email activity 3 to 10 times.” The tool will be in Setup under “<strong>Autocreation Settings”</strong> and the Seller Home screen will give you an at-a-glance glimpse of how many new contacts have been created in the previous 7 days.

And, if you’re a bit more “manual” minded — you can of course have the integration simply suggest contacts for approval (as opposed to automatically creating them), so you can create the ones you want with a click, instead of a lot of typing, copying, pasting, etc…!

## BONUS: Update Contact Records Automatically

And that’s not the only time and effort saving get-data-into-our-org-and-keep-it-up-to-date upgrade! Thanks to [AI and Automatic Contact Enhancement](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_sales_feature_core_contacts_enhance.htm&release=250&type=5), we’ll be able to “see generative AI and Automatic Contact Enhancements to add phone, address, title, seniority level, department group, and buyer attributes (such as decision maker or detractor) automatically to your contacts based on sales activity” and, in a move that’s sure to be a boon on revenue strategy calls and for sales and marketing alike, we’ll now be able to “show contacts with this information on a buyer relationship map, which helps you visualize key players in your deal or account.”!
Hello improved win rates, better audience segmentation, more accurate ideal prospect profiles, and more revenue! Not to mention a great new visualization for those executive calls.
So that’s it! Two brand new ways that Summer ’24 will be driving adoption, accuracy, and revenue! And freeing up your team to focus on the things they do best — their jobs!
Be sure to stay tuned here for more Summer ’24 feature highlights as we continue our countdown to go-live, and let us know what you’r emost excited abotu in the comments!
Until next time, keep working hard, smart, and happy. And we’ll see you in the cloud!

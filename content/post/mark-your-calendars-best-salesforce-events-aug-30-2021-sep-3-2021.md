I can’t believe we are already entering September. I can feel the holidays sneaking up on us, and I’m not ready for them and the event planning that comes with that in both my professional and personal life. Luckily the events this week don’t have a hint of the holidays in them, so we can sit back, open up our calendars and get planning!

We are starting off the week in the UK, but not really. In fact, the only thing British about this webinar is the accents and the time zone it’s occurring in (\*cough British Summer Time cough\*). At 11am (BST aka 3am PST and 6am EST) on Tuesday, August 31st, Salesforce is hosting [Deliver, Manage, and Measure Programs at a Scale with the Power of the Salesforce Ecosystem](https://www.salesforce.com/uk/form/sfdo/ngo/measure-programs/?_ga=2.110703872.401537430.1629929078-1449393581.1625164245). This event is an AppExchange event that will feature 4 companies showcasing their apps, and how they can help nonprofits. If you are into demos and want to see what the AppExchange has to offer, I would recommend joining in!

Our next event is also starting at 11am, but don’t worry it’s PST, so we can go back to bed and be prepared for this one. In [6 Steps for Small Business SEO Success](https://www.salesforce.com/form/events/webinars/form-rss/3346439), Salesforce is teaching small business owners how to “get noticed” by search audiences on platforms like Google. This webinar will help teach how to drive traffic to your site, and we are talking about the type of traffic that will actually become customers, not any of those mambo jumbo bots. These tips will include how to interact with your prospects, the type of keywords you should select, and what you can do to improve your Google rank. SEO’s are considered one of the most cost efficient ways for small businesses to build with lasting results, so what are you waiting for?!

We all love a good update and hearing about new features in the Salesforce platform and E[mpower Your Sale and Service Teams with Learning in the Flow of Work](https://www.salesforce.com/form/events/webinars/form-rss/3345315) will deliver that for us myTrailhead peps! As always you’ll hear from product experts, see live demos, and be able to ask questions live during the event. However, for the sales and service teams specifically, it will show how myTrailhead can: onboard quickly, manage processes efficiently, skill-up new hires and re-skill veterans easily, and basically training for everyone to understand the bottomline. This event is also on Tuesday, August 31st at 11am (PST).

We have another event geared towards nonprofits, however anyone who plans events or has to adapt to their supporters needs can attend! In [CMO Council: Driving Long-Term Engagement and Allyship in Challenging Times](https://www.salesforce.com/form/sfdo/ngo/long-term-engagement/?_ga=2.110703872.401537430.1629929078-1449393581.1625164245), representatives from the YMCA, JCC, and the Boys and Girls Club of America will have a panel discussion about trends shaping digital, in-person, and hybrid events. They will also talk about engagement strategies, and trends shaping nonprofits. This event is occurring on Thursday, September 2nd at 9am (PST).

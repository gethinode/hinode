Hooray! As Flow-vember draws to a close, I’ve completed our [Flow-vember Trailmix](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/users/cstegall/trailmixes/flow-vember) and learned a ton about Salesforce’s awesome automation tool (and hopefully you have too)! So what’s next? How can you continue to build on that knowledge, and make sure you still have it long after the holidays have passed?
In this installment of My Flow-vember Journey, we’ll chat about concluding this quest, consolidate our takeaways from the experience, and offer some insight into retaining the knowledge and potential next steps!

## Continue Learning Within Trailhead

As I completed the hands-on challenges within each module, I realized that most of the instructions and steps require you to have a fairly solid understanding of Salesforce fundamentals. That doesn’t mean you can’t complete them, but if you know the basics, it makes it a lot easier to understand why Elements, Resources, and Variables are used in different combinations. So, if you find yourself getting hung up on the “how’s” and “why’s”, consider the types of use cases you plan to use Flows for, then go back to Trailhead to practice and learn more about those specific areas of the platform.
Once you have a better understanding, take another shot at building Flows around tasks you need to complete, within your org, on an everyday basis. Start simple and work your way up! There’s always something new to learn, and it’s way easier when you can apply it to your day-to-day efforts!
When in doubt, head back to Trailhead to learn some more.

## Retain What You’ve Learned and Apply It

Just because we completed this Trailmix doesn’t mean we’ll retain it forever. The above advice also comes in handy for improving retention! Apply what you’ve learned to something you do every day. For example, if you work around any of the standard objects (Accounts, Opportunities, Contacts, Leads, or Cases) within your Salesforce org, find ways to build Flows around these objects and begin automating tasks to free up time and resources. Once again, start small and find the simplest task you or someone else, in your org, has to complete and use Flow to automate it.
These applications will help you “lock-in” your knowledge for use down the road. After all, there’s always room for automation!

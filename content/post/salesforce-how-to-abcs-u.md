In 2024, there’s a good chance you’ve heard of Salesforce. And, if you’re here, I’m almost 100% certain you have. As the world’s leading CRM and the source of so many life-changing opportunities, a thriving community, and rich app-ecosystem — it’s a platform that thousands of new Trailblazers take to each day. But how do you get started and how do businesses actually “use” Salesforce. That’s likely why so many folks are Googling “Salesforce how to use”!

And that makes this the perfect time for the next installment of our Salesforce “How to ABCs”, the series where we tackle the most commonly Googled Salesforce questions, letter by letter, to help Trailblazers find the answers they’re looking for fast! Today’s letter is “U” as in, “Salesforce How to Use”. It’s a bit syntax-ically clunky, but it’s got the spirit!
Let’s dive in!

## The Basics

With over 150K customers Salesforce allows businesses to manage customer relationships from just about anywhere. Both data and information associated with each customer account can be stored and accessed in one central location.
This process makes it easy to manage sales deals, launch marketing campaigns, and respond to customer issues and inquiries all while everyone is kept up to date with the latest updates and changes.

## Why is CRM Important

Before we can begin to use Salesforce, we must understand why CRM is important. Most, if not all, businesses manage customer relationships in some way, shape, or form. From segmenting audiences to organizing prospect information in more detail and at a massive scale. A CRM solution ensures a unified communication channel across all departments is available at the glance of a web page. That is where Salesforce shines and thrives.
Salesforce helps you manage relationships through customer lifecycles in one central location. Seek new leads, and win over new business all while providing support and acquiring more services throughout the process.
Salesforce is a CRM solution that helps you focus on your organization’s relationships with individual people. Learn more about CRM using their handy [CRM 101](https://www.salesforce.com/crm/what-is-crm/) notes.

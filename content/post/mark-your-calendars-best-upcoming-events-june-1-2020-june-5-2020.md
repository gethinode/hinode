Most of this week’s events have the underlying theme about inspiration, getting through these challenging times and aligning your goals. Businesses may be slowly reopening around the world, but we still have a lot of adjusting and learning to do. So sit back, open up your calendars and let’s get planning!

Zions Bank will be the guest speaker and they will be educating Financial Institutions on how to lead their businesses during COVID-19.

They will go over a 7 step process (workbook included) on goal setting and how to make that a reality. If you don’t have your business or personal goals set and in order by the end of this week, I’m going to be disappointed.

Last week we had a shorter work week in the US, but that didn’t stop us from having all of these events! We were inspired by Irma Olguin Jr in **Ambition, Opportunity and Impact: A Conversation with Irma Olguin Jr.**
We refined our code customization skills in **Discover a Lightning Fast Way to Debug in Salesforce with RFLIB.**
We learned how colleges and universities are addressing this new world in **A New Reality for Higher Ed Marketing and Communications.**
Additionally, we got a lesson on how to maximize Pardot in 10 steps in **Virtual Pardot Event: How to Eat an Elephant and Maximize Pardot.**
If you are a new Admin hopefully you were able to attend **Essential Habits for New Admins, **but if not, no worries. There is one of these classes almost every week! Did you have a good time discussing new or old apps in **If you’re Appy and you know It**. [Tweet us](https://twitter.com/mkpartners) and let us know which app you thought should have won!
Lastly, we had the event **#Journey2Salesforce** over the weekend. Was this event educational for all you non-Salesforce professionals out there? Did you attend any of these events or classes? Tweet us [@mkpartners](https://twitter.com/mkpartners) and let us know your thoughts!
Also, make sure to let us know if you think there are any other events worth mentioning and what you’re most excited about this upcoming week. And, as always, we will see you in the cloud.

With [TrailblazerDX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADt4yUn49E0) in the rearview and the [Summer ’23 Release](https://medium.com/creme-de-la-crm/releasehighlights/home) just over the horizon, our feeds are full of new features, product news, and the inspiring Trailblazer stories that get us fired up to continue improving our Salesforce skill set!
Whether it’s the latest in Einstein AI, Slack, Salesforce Genie, or the rest of the Salesforce product line, there’s nothing like a pending release on the coattails of a big Salesforce event to get you psyched up to tackle your next cert exam — and maybe yours will be free!
That’s right, in honor of last month’s TDX (and especially those that weren’t able to make the trip to SF who had to follow along virtually), we wanted to help one lucky Trailblazer keep their Salesforce career climbing, and so, for two more days, our [Mambo Merge x TDX ’23 Cert Contest is Live](https://gleam.io/gYzqg/mambo-merge-x-tdx-23-giveaway)!
{{< image src="/img/1_OJOSYMgpdAX4UGsVWNcvWQ.png" title="Image" >}}

Just complete any (or all) of the activities above ([here’s the link again](https://gleam.io/gYzqg/mambo-merge-x-tdx-23-giveaway)) and, in a few days, one lucky winner will receive a voucher to take their next Salesforce cert exam, on us!
And, in the meantime, be sure to subscribe here and follow along on our other socials for live looks at TDX, the [Summer ’23 Release](https://medium.com/creme-de-la-crm/releasehighlights/home), the latest in Salesforce news, tips, tricks, and how-to’s from all around the world of Salesforce.
Keep working hard, smart, and happy.
And we’ll see you in the cloud.

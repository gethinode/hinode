As Salesforce Partners, Clients, and Users begin to receive more emails in their inboxes for the Summer ’24 Release — others get ahead of the game by leveraging stand-alone environments within each release.
Let’s Dive In!

## Pre-Release Org Sign-Up

Every platform must change several times a year to improve existing features, remove others, and add new functionality that is relevant to the ongoing changes in the verticals or industries around them. Change is inevitable and will always require platforms to take action and adjust.
If you enjoy learning, building, and exploring a platform without the need to worry about flipping switches and making a platform crash then you are on the right path to leverage the resource offered by Salesforce during each Release.
On April 18th Salesforce users, a.k.a Trailblazers, will have the opportunity to sign up and access a pre-release org. This will be a Salesforce Developer Edition environment, provided by Salesforce, which will include all the latest changes coming with the Summer ’24 Release.

## Benefits Of Using A Pre-Release Org

The ability to gain access to upcoming changes to a platform allows anyone to try and find out what happens when you do this… or if you change that… without the need of impacting anyone using the platform.
No matter your role within the ecosystem. Leverage this resource to gain access and get a sneak-peak preview of changes coming to features and functionality you use. Find out what feature changes may require adjustment to your existing tasks or unlock new features that will enhance what you are already doing.
You don’t have to be an expert and come to realize that an extra pair of eyes helps see things from a different perspective. As more and more people begin to access their Pre-Release Org they will help identify similar findings which will help spark conversation and alert others of changes coming to an org near you.

## Conclusion

The Pre-Release Org intends to encourage everyone to try the changes coming to org’s everywhere. While some help address existing issues provided by individuals like yourself, others are part of the ongoing changes around the industry.
Share with us the way you prepare for the upcoming changes as the countdown to the Summer ’24 Release is here.
Until then, keep working hard, smart, and happy. We’ll see you in the cloud.

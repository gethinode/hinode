The time has come to officially kick off [Dreamforce](https://www.salesforce.com/dreamforce/) 2023 taking place over in San Fransisco once again. Between Sep 12–14th there will be a HUGE emphasis on Artificial Intelligence (AI) so anticipate a lot of discussions around the topic as we are eager to learn more about this innovative technology.
Join our [Mambo Merge](https://www.mambomerge.com/) and [MK Partners](https://www.mkpartners.com/) teams as they prepare a series of livestreams to keep those not able to attend up to date with the latest findings and highlights for each day. The series will begin with a kickoff each day in the morning then followed up with a recap later in the evening to cover all the findings.
Get comfy, grab a snack, and get ready to tune in this week. You’re not gonna want to miss out.

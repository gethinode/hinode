Our Trailblazer journey continues as we head over to the beautiful resort city of South Lake Tahoe, CA. Here will join other amazing Trailblazers in a relaxing and fun environment. With this being their fifth Community Conference they are happy and proud to be able host and operate this event by people in the Salesforce Community, for the Salesforce Community.
Taking place at the Harrah’s Convention Center, [Tahoe Dreamin’](https://tahoedreamin.com/) will run from August 4th through the 5th. This in-person event is geared around Salesforce learning, building relationships, and having fun. Connect with other Trailblazers, Admins, Developers, Architects, and Partners and engage with all of the sponsors who contribute to this event. You’ll want to make sure to pick up your badge at the registration desk along with any goodies they have in-store for attendees. Find out what breakout sessions you plan on adding to your calendar and be sure attend the keynote speakers. Lastly, don’t forget to check out the happy hour networking sessions each day!

## And Be Sure to Stop By Our Booth and Say “Hello!”

While you’re planning out your schedule make sure you allocate some time to visit the [Mambo Merge](http://www.mambomerge.com) booth along with all the other sponsors! Why, you ask? Well, it’s simple. We have collaborated with TD and other sponsors to bring you a prize-packed Sponsor Bingo activity in which attendees will have a chance to win some pretty cool stuff! Learn more about the activity [here](https://events.mkpartners.com/SponsorBingoTD). (And keep an eye out on slack and social media for more information.)
Lastly, all attendees will receive three months of our [Mambo Merge](https://www.mambomerge.com/) PRO edition for FREE which unlocks all the features you need in order to make document generation within Salesforce simple, seamless and secure. Generate documents at the push of a button, and you can get started today by installing it from the[ AppExchange](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxListingDetail?listingId=a0N3u00000MBinOEAT).
While there you’ll also have the chance to meet some of the team members and ask any and all of your doc-gen-related questions. They’ll be more than happy to assist. And if you’re a Salesforce partner or consultant, be sure to ask about our Partner Program to unlock even more resources for you and your customers!
It’s great to have in-person events back again and we’ll look forward to seeing you there!

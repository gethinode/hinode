Our Trailblazer journey continues as we hitch a flight over to the city of Minneapolis, MN where we’ll be exploring the original community run event, led by a ‘Super User Group’ of Salesforce professionals and community leaders, Midwest Dreamin’!
Taking place at the Hyatt Regency, [Midwest Dreamin’](https://www.midwestdreamin.com/) will run from July 20th through the 22nd. This in-person event is like a “mini Dreamforce” geared around Salesforce learning, building relationships, and having fun. Connect with other Trailblazers, Admins and Developers. Engage with all of the sponsors who contributed to this event. You’ll want to make sure to pick up your badge at the registration desk along with any goodies they have in-store for attendees. Find out what breakout sessions you plan on adding to your calendar and be sure attend the keynote speakers. Lastly, don’t forget to check out the Mega Demo Jam finale which takes place on the 22nd!
If you’re attending, stay up to date of all the changes to the agenda, sessions, speakers, attendees community and much more by using their convenient [Whova](https://whova.com/) App. Easily downloaded and installed from the Google or Apple stores.

## And Be Sure to Stop By Our Booth and Say “Hello!”

While you’re planning out your schedule make sure you allocate some time to visit the Mambo Merge booth along with all the other sponsors! Why, you ask? Well, it’s simple. We have collaborated with MWD and other sponsors to bring you a prize-packed Sponsor Bingo activity in which attendees will have a chance to win some pretty cool stuff! Learn more about the activity [here](https://events.mkpartners.com/SponsorBingoMWD). (And keep an eye out on social media for more information.)
Lastly, all attendees will receive three months of [Mambo Merge](https://www.mambomerge.com/) PRO edition for FREE which unlocks all the features you need in order to make document generation within Salesforce simple, seamless and secure. Generate documents at the push of a button, and you can get started today by installing it from the[ AppExchange](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxListingDetail?listingId=a0N3u00000MBinOEAT).
While there you’ll also have the chance to meet some of the team members and ask any and all of your doc-gen-related questions. They’ll be more than happy to assist. And if you’re a Salesforce partner or consultant, be sure to ask about our Partner Program to unlock even more resources for you and your customers!
It’s great to have in-person events back again and we’ll look forward to seeing you there!

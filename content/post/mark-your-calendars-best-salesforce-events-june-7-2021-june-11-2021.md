I’ll be in the middle of the woods during this week, so y’all will have to let me know what events you attend and how you like them! So sit back, open up your calendar, and let’s get planning!

We are starting off our week with the Seattle, WA Salesforce Admin group for the [Seattle Group Meeting](https://trailblazercommunitygroups.com/events/details/salesforce-salesforce-admin-group-seattle-united-states-presents-june-8th-seattle-group-meeting/) on Tuesday, June 8th. Starting at 8am (PDT), this meeting will focus on certifications, learning pathways, and career development in the Salesforce ecosystem. A guest speaker from Trailhead academy will be there to talk about these topics and then viewers will have a chance to ask a recruiter for career related questions in a Q&A session.

Then on Wednesday, June 9th Salesforce has its annual [Industries Summit](https://invite.salesforce.com/industriessummit/SFWebsite). This one day event will have sessions across all industries and more than 65 speakers in attendance! They haven’t posted a start time, but it is encouraged to invite your fellow employees and customers to learn about Salesforce’s latest innovations. Check out the site to register and see what industries are the focus of this summit.

Our next event is at 6pm (EDT) and is hosted by the Lexington Salesforce Admin group. [How to land your first job in the Salesforce ecosystem and then Grow](https://trailblazercommunitygroups.com/events/details/salesforce-salesforce-admin-group-lexington-united-states-presents-how-to-land-your-first-job-in-the-salesforce-ecosystem-and-then-grow-presented-by-austin-sherman/) (a mouthful, I know) is having guest speaker, Austin Sherman, talk about getting a job in the ecosystem and then going beyond that to get into consulting. This event is great for anyone newer to the ecosystem and wants to learn more about all of the Salesforce job opportunities. The presentation will start at 6:30pm (EDT) after the group goes over member achievements and topics for future meetings.

Back a few blog posts ago, I talked about the Bellingham Salesforce Nonprofit User group having a 2 part session around rollups. Well they have finally announced [Virtual Meeting: Rollups, Part 2](https://trailblazercommunitygroups.com/events/details/salesforce-salesforce-nonprofit-user-group-bellingham-united-states-presents-virtual-meeting-rollups-part-2-take-2/) for Thursday, June 10th! The group leaders and guest speaker will scour and review AppExchange and other tools that can help you build rollups with little to no code! They will review rollup examples to show you the basics, and any sneaky sneaks that might getcha! Additionally, they are going to share resources to practice SOQL. The event starts at 12pm (PT) and make sure to RSVP to get the Zoom link.

Next at 3pm the Salt Lake City, UT Salesforce Developer group wants to spend time catching up! In [Hybrid (Virtual / In Person) — Pet Projects](https://trailblazercommunitygroups.com/events/details/salesforce-salesforce-developer-group-salt-lake-city-united-states-presents-hybrid-virtual-in-person-pet-projects/) the group leaders want to hear about any pet projects you have been working on during Covid that you would be willing to share with the group. If you are interested, send the group leaders you project so they can add it to the list. Additionally, this event will be partially in-person, but the location still needs to be determined.

If you all have noticed, all of the Dreamin conferences are coming back! And [CzechDreamin](https://czechdreamin.com/) is coming back virtually for a 2 hour event also on Thursday, June 10th (but they are several hours ahead of the USA so pay attention to the date and times). From 5pm to 7pm (CEST) this conference will focus on a little bit of everything Salesforce. They want to make sure there is something for everyone and plan on each session having 20 slides that last 20 seconds each! No pressure on the speakers or anything lol. They may even have a surprise for you once you get your ticket (it’s free, but you still need one)!

## Recap

The main attraction of last week, Connections 2021, was back to teach marketers, commerce professionals, and digital leaders more about new and upcoming experiences in the Salesforce ecosystem. You can head over to [MK Partners Youtube page](https://youtu.be/k0o251Q7PrQ) to hear about Chris Stegall’s and my experience and thoughts about Connections if you are interested. The San Diego Salesforce User group and the San Francisco Salesforce Marketer group both hosted a watch party for Connections 2021, but just for the keynote speech. A Tale of Digital Transformation to Rescue Millions by 2030, the only other event of the week, discussed how the International Justice Mission (IJM) rallied global societies to invest in and reform justice systems in poorer areas of the world. Tweet us [@mkpartners](http://www.twitter.com/mkpartners) and let us know what your favorite event was!

And, as always, we will see you in the cloud!

April ended with a trio of high-demand, high-turnout, and high-value Salesforce events thrown by the platform and its ever-growing community of users, champions, and Trailblazers!

[TrailblazerDX](https://www.salesforce.com/trailblazerdx/) took over Moscone in San Francisco for West Coaster’s while the East Coast community gathered in Providence, RI for [Northeast Dreamin’](https://northeastdreamin.com/) and those in the South gathered in Austin for [Texas Dreamin’](https://www.texasdreamin.org/)!

The scheduling overlap still hints at shaking off some of those no-in-person-events-for-a-while cobwebs that had a chance to form while the pandemic pushed these meetups remote for the better part of two years but, for those that were able to attend, these events offered a nice return to the swing of things and a reminder just how powerful, expansive, and excited the Salesforce community can be face to face!

For [MK Partners](https://www.mkpartners.com/) I headed up to SF for TrailblazerDX (and also got to spend some time in the spotlight at the [Salesforce+](https://www.salesforce.com/plus/) lounge, chatting about [Legends of Low Code](https://www.salesforce.com/plus/series/Legends_of_Low_Code) — Salesforce’s first reality show) and on behalf of [Mambo Merge](https://www.mambomerge.com/), Jesus jetted out to Rhode Island to meet the East Coast community for the first time.

And, while we were there, we took the chance to hop on a video call to compare keynotes, session offerings, highlights, and more!

All in all, the events were a delight and offered a ton of learning opportunities for admins, devs, users, and partners alike. And, perhaps best of all, all three events brought Trailblazers back together for the first time in years — and you could already see sparks of the innovation that always follows these events.

Give the video a watch and, if you missed the events this time around, you can still catch [virtual sessions online](https://www.salesforce.com/plus/experience/TrailblazerDX_2022/series/Best_of_TrailblazerDX/episode/episode-s1e1)!

Until next time, keep working hard, smart, and happy. And we’ll see you in the cloud!

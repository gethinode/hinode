The clocks are back where they belong, the sun is back to shining (eclipses not withstanding), and the temperatures are back on the upswing — and all that can only mean one thing: the Summer ’24 Release will be here before you know it!
Well, not before you know it, thanks to our handy timeline:
{{< image src="/img/1_v18w4PNUAgIi2chFdbzwaA.png" title="Image" >}}

But we know how those weeks have a habit of sliding right by and, lucky for us, we got a little bit of a release treat — the [Release Notes](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.salesforce_release_notes.htm&language=en_US&type=5&release=250) are here a couple days early!
That, of course, means we’ll be kicking off the latest round of our [Release Highlights series](https://medium.com/creme-de-la-crm/releasehighlights/home), where we’ll pore over the fine print looking for the features, updates, and upgrades that stand out to us as the most time-saving, meaningful, game-changing, and have the greatest potential to increase your platform ROI!
And our clients’!
And our own!
But feel free to get a jump start yourselves as well! The Summer ’24 Release Notes can be found [right here](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.salesforce_release_notes.htm&language=en_US&type=5&release=250). And be sure to subscribe here so you’ll be the first to know when we start diving deeper into the features that will keep us cool all Summer long.
Until then, keep working hard, smart, and happy. And we’ll see you in the cloud!

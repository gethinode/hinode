First of all, let me just say as an active donor to the American Red Cross, it’s important to give what you can to what has occurred with _Hurricane Ian_ in Florida. I highly encourage it. Through YouTube, I was able to find a mock-up of a _Local Forecast_ video with visual graphics from _The Weather Channel_ for it from the Early 1990s (and I’m still not quite certain how this was pulled off.) Apparently it’s using a device called “WS4000 Simulator”.

However, the logistics of powering it up seems to be on the level of Salesforce’s Einstein package — A _Very_ powerful platform. _Einstein_ by Salesforce has made recent enhancements to their overall package:

### What is Einstein Exactly?

[Einstein for Marketing Cloud](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.marketing_cloud_einstein.htm&type=5) uses Salesforce’s AI to help you best evaluate and implement your marketing activities. Use valuable insights on audiences, send time, engagement frequency, and your content to best target your customers. Deliver information to your customers when they need it and how they need it.

Einstein in Marketing Cloud offers a range of opportunities for you to analyze, automate, and optimize your content. Use the [apps](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_anb_einstein_and_data.htm&type=5) throughout Marketing Cloud platforms to gain insight and better target your audiences.

**These Marketing Cloud platforms feature Einstein for Marketing Cloud:**

**Messaging and Journeys (M&J)** = Professional (Add On), Corporate, Enterprise, Enterprise+, **Pardot** = Advanced, **Customer Data Platform** = Dependent on M&J edition.

### The Key Marketing Operations Served by Einstein for Marketing Cloud = Smart Segmentation, Orchestration & Content:

- Einstein Engagement Scoring predicts consumer engagement with email and mobile push messaging. It uses customer data and machine learning to generate predictive models that assign scores to a contact’s likelihood to engage with emails.

- Einstein Send Time Optimization (STO) determines the best time to send an email or push notification.

- Einstein Engagement Frequency evaluates your contacts and identifies the optimal number of email messages or push notifications to send. Avoid a lack of awareness from too few messages or burnout from too many messages.

- Einstein Copy Insights analyzes the text from your email subject lines to uncover language insights. Use these insights to craft subject lines that drive stronger email engagement.

- Use Einstein Content Selection to send personalized content to each customer when they engage with your messages. Supply Einstein with content assets, and Einstein selects the best content for each contact based on their profile and category affinity.

### THE LATEST & GREATEST New Einstein Search Features:

Einstein Search provides improved search experience at no additional cost. Einstein Search for Knowledge, which is now generally available, makes it easier for service agents to locate relevant articles. Users can also interact with new Einstein Search Answers enhancements and save answers and links to their clipboards:

- [Boost Agent Productivity with Einstein Search for Knowledge](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_search_esk_ga.htm&type=5&language=en_US&release=240):
  Service agents can find relevant articles faster and respond to customers more accurately for expedited case resolution. Einstein Search for Knowledge is now generally available.

- [Resolve Cases Quickly with Interactive Einstein Search Answers (Pilot)](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_search_enhanced_answers.htm&type=5&language=en_US&release=240):
  Agents can take immediate action by using Einstein Search Answers to extract the most relevant information from a knowledge article. The returned answers are just three lines so that agents can copy the answer and its internal link to their clipboard and then share it without leaving the page. Previously, agents opened the record page and then copied the URL and section of an article.

## BOTTOM LINE:

Search queries for agents using the Einstein platform should be good to go with these new enhancements. “Einstein Search” has significantly improved as returned answers (answers and links) can be saved to user’s respective clipboard(s).

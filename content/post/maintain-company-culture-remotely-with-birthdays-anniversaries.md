With the global pandemic drastically reshaping the working world, companies everywhere are looking for ways to maintain their long-developed company cultures, especially with the sudden shift to remote work and a physically distant workforce.
As always, one of the most important aspects of keeping morale high and your teams on the same page is to celebrate successes, birthdays, and milestones. Pre-COVID birthdays could be as easy as a cake in the breakroom, passing a card around the office for everyone to sign, and a rendition of “Happy Birthday” at lunch. And work anniversaries might have been as simple as an “all-hands” email congratulating your colleague on another incredible year of service. But now, with your teams spread across the city, it can be a challenge to achieve that same level of awareness, recognition, and keep any important dates from slipping through the cracks. That’s why we built [Birthdays and Anniversaries](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxListingDetail?listingId=a0N3A00000GA7tkUAD) for our Salesforce org (and yours)!

This free, lightweight Lightning Web Component automatically generates a timeline of important, upcoming dates for your users, so you can be sure everyone knows what’s on the horizon and nobody gets forgotten.
Easy to add to any Page Layout, it’s a super simple way to keep everyone up to speed and it’ll save your admins time tracking and sending out calendar reminders asking everyone to remember to send over their well-wishes.
All that’s left is deciding how you’ll help your team celebrate on the day!

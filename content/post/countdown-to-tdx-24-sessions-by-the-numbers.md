As we clear the 2-week countdown for [TrailblazerDX](https://go.mkp.dev/TDXPromo) many look for all the resources available to get more insights and share knowledge between each other and the Trailblazer community. As Salesforce continues to release more and more information before their event look for us to help digest the details with some helpful visuals to make sense of it all.
Share with us what you like in the comments below. Without further ado, let’s dive in.
Each TrailblazerDX resources like [Salesforce Admins](https://admin.salesforce.com/blog/2023/the-trailblazerdx-2024-call-for-participation-is-now-open) provide a breakdown of the benefits of presenting a session, steps to submit sessions, the different session types, topics of interest to consider, and much more. This year thousands of sessions were submitted but only hundreds were selected and refined to be included.
With so many innovations taking place last year such as Salesforce [AI Day](https://www.salesforce.com/plus/experience/salesforce_ai_day/series/salesforce_ai_day/episode/episode-s1e1), and [Dreamforce AI](https://www.salesforce.com/blog/ai-for-it/) we take a look at some key session stats and findings we’d like to share with the community.

## Session Types

Referencing the handy [FAQ section](https://www.salesforce.com/trailblazerdx/faq/?_gl=1*74qgfk*_ga*MTY3NTkzNzA3OC4xNzA3MTcwMzA3*_ga_HPRCE01J19*MTcwODQ5MzgyNC40NS4xLjE3MDg0OTYyMDguMC4wLjA.#learnmore) within the site we can gather the following intel. Looking at the compiled graph we can see that a little less than half of the sessions for this year will focus on informative or specific topics such as how-tos or tips and tricks.
These (20 min) <strong>Theater</strong> sessions are always welcomed as more and more first-timers attend events such as this and seek for new ways to become productive and get things done within the Salesforce platform. As for existing Trailblazers, it&#39;s always nice to get a refresher from time to time on a topic or feature since changes always take place with each new SF release (coming soon — Summer ’24, Winter ’25, Spring ‘25).
{{< image src="/img/1_xYuA_F_RLLP9ox0KK4Vzuw.png" title="Image" >}}

We shift to the <strong>Breakout</strong> (30–40 min) sessions next which span around 1 out of every 4 sessions taking place during the 2-day event. These provide speakers to go into a deep dive discussion on specific topics or features with Q&amp;A and a more focused and technical presentation. Expect some great speakers to take center stage. So head over to the Agenda Builder and begin adding a session or two to your agenda.

The rest of the sessions which cover the last third of the catalog consist of <strong>Campfires</strong>, <strong>Roundtables</strong>, and <strong>Hands-on Workshops</strong>. These type of sessions are tailored for small group discussions, community leaders, and hands-on training. Many will appreciate them so check your calendar and slot in a few.
Save the best for last we say, and that we do. The [Keynotes](https://reg.salesforce.com/flow/plus/tdx24/sessioncatalog/page/Catalog?_ga=2.162352380.1542455395.1708397860-1675937078.1707170307&_gac=1.188007258.1708047977.CjwKCAiAibeuBhAAEiwAiXBoJORYB8CXJfB7nLtkMt8e_3FtXzY7PDa1DyjAloM7DoN4qkAppOzD3BoC3PkQAvD_BwE&tab.day=20240306&search.sessiontypebraidlearnmorehrefhttpswwwsalesforcecomtrailblazerdxfaqlearnmoretargetblanklearnmorea=sessionType_keynote), are the creme of the crop and the reason why many look to hear from Industry Leaders who shape the Salesforce world. This year these sessions will be taking place on the first day. You will want to slot these into your agenda and make sure to tune in. Everyone from around the world will be watching.

## Session Levels

Now that you have a sense of the different types of sessions will break them even more. This time around, we’ll look at their technical levels. In this graphic, we take a look at the Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced levels per session. As per previous requests from the Trailblazer community, more and more sessions are getting past the basics and going above and beyond.
{{< image src="/img/1_oZ2DpRm4S2UA_cqlJ8Mavg.png" title="Image" >}}

The Intermediate Tier closes in with a little less than half of the catalog sessions, followed by a close second by the Beginner Tier. The Advanced tier tends to be a nitch and focused group of Speakers willing to share knowledge if you are ahead of the curve. Don’t worry and feel free to join any session level to get a feel and sense of what things to keep an eye out for on topics you plan to pursue or learn more about.

## Session Roles

TrailblazerDX is catered for Developers, Admins, and Architects but anyone is welcome to attend. Therefore it comes as no surprise that the following graphic paints that picture. Over two-thirds of the sessions target Admins and Developers or a hybrid being called an “Admineloper” while the rest cover the other roles.
{{< image src="/img/1_imXk4KOnDYttJGk_d05IWw.png" title="Image" >}}

As a first-timer or ongoing attendee keep in mind that everyone is helpful and willing to talk and listen to see how they can help. This is the nature of the ecosystem and what makes these events that much more enjoyable. So, feel free to add a few sessions (if your calendar permits) that may not cater to your role and get more acquainted.

## Salesforce+

Every Salesforce event has a livestream component that runs simultaneously alongside the days of the event. So, if you cannot attend in person, log into [Salesforce+](https://www.salesforce.com/plus), and stream for FREE! Of course, not all sessions will be able to stream but the Keynotes for sure along with some selected sessions.
Make sure to check the agenda and see if the <strong>Available on Salesforce+</strong> is marked. If yes, then you can watch it (once it gets published). While keynotes are livestreamed in real-time the rest of the sessions may not. Check the site, once you have selected your sessions, to see if they will be streamed in real time. If not, check back in a day or two and they should be up.

## In Closing

It&#39;s always important to consider how to spend your time during an in-person event or event while livestreaming. Check out the [session catalog](https://reg.salesforce.com/flow/plus/tdx24/sessioncatalog/page/Catalog) and make sure to fill up that calendar each day. Plan your route, (or live streams at home) and have fun.
As always let us know what you think of would like for us to cover in our next installment.

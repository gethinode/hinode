To celebrate both occasions, the Irvine Salesforce Admin Group decide to throw together an in-person Pi Day Extravaganza!
Let’s recap this Pi-rrific experience.

## Pies All around

This meetup took place at the [Pitfire Mar Vista](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Pitfire+Pizza/@33.9946815,-118.4387608,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x8e1d4aec8c3342ca?sa=X&ved=1t:2428&ictx=111) location near the crossings between the 405 Freeway and 90 West. Those SoCal Trailblazers nearby splurged and indulged in a variety of savory pizzas and assortment of sweet and savory pies, there was something for every type of taste bud. Vegan and vegetarian options were available, ensuring a diverse culinary experience for all who attended. Fountain beverages were included but alcoholic drinks required a purchase.

## Activities

If you didn’t know, last week Tr(AI)lblazerDX attendees won a Guinness World Record for having more than 885 Einsteins running around the third floor of Moscone West! Many Trailblazers, including myself, got a chance to experience this phenomenon live and let me tell you, it was wild and energetic! It will be talked about for many years to come.

It was nice to know fellow Einsteine-rs came together and competed in the pie-eating contest taking place. Along with the Social Bingo and Jeopardy activities, many exciting prizes were given away. Like this Data Rockstar Astro plush. Too bad it didn’t come with that sweet guiiitarrrr…

## In Conclusion

Although I was not able to attend, due to unforeseen circumstances, some of my colleagues were able to go and shared the experience. Everyone had a great time and got to connect with other Trailblazers in person.

To catch the next one, be sure to check their [community page](https://trailblazercommunitygroups.com/salesforce-admin-group-irvine-united-states/) to see when the next meetup takes place and let us know what you look forward to in your next in-person meetup!

Until next time, keep working hard, smart, and happy — and we’ll see you in the cloud!

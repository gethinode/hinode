Two new & exciting Intelligence sub-products will be making their debut for the Winter ’23 Marketing Cloud release = **_Sprout Social_ _Connector_ & _Ecommerce Marketing Insights App_.** These are in the release notes and seem to be flying under the radar a bit, so shedding light on their upcoming capabilities is, without a doubt, important. Both products are available in all MC Intelligence Editions (Starter, Growth, & Plus).

**_Sprout Social Connector:_** All social data from Sprout Social will be able to be combined with web analytics, sales, and any marketing data for spend and revenue optimization. A photo example is above.

In summary, if your org is using **_Sprout Social_**, all that data will now**\*\***roll up directly to the “Social Studio” Marketing Cloud Application. It’s a primary tool which allows for more detail within the app as a dynamic sub tab within Marketing Cloud. On a high level, the largest benefit for using this platform would be to merge additional Sales & Marketing data into a single view for additional use.

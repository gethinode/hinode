The countdown to TDX is underway, this year’s [Agenda Builder is live](https://reg.salesforce.com/flow/plus/tdx24/sessioncatalog/page/Catalog?_ga=2.234547870.1609681575.1708463141-2031003552.1708103214&tab.day=20240306), and Trailblazers all over the world are picking sessions and packing their schedules for another amazing event in San Francisco.
With over 200 sessions to choose from, we figured it might be helpful to sit down with some speakers, learn a bit about what they’ll be presenting, and ask them a few TDX-themed questions — while they’re in the spotlight.
To kick things off and give the other speakers some insight into what to expect when they join, I went first — so here’s our TDX Speaker Spotlight for me, Chris Stegall!

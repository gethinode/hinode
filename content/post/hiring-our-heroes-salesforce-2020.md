Salesforce is an industry leader in doing good. From starting the [Pledge 1% movement](https://medium.com/creme-de-la-crm/pledge-1-success-stories-602f06c2b3bb?source=collection_home---4------0-----------------------) to supporting worthy causes around the world --- their charitable contributions to communities everywhere are unmatched.

Their [partnership with Hiring Our Heroes](https://www.hiringourheroes.org/fellowships/salesforce-fellowship-program/) is just another example of that terrific and supportive outreach. If you're unfamiliar, HoH collaborates with companies to place military personnel and military spouse fellows at companies all over the country for 12-week, on-the-job, professional development opportunities that can smoothly segue into technical careers! And the Salesforce ecosystem is maybe the perfect place to pick up those kind of relevant skills.

Check out the video below where Caylin and I chat about the partnership and MK Partner's recent experience hosting a marketing fellow (remotely)!

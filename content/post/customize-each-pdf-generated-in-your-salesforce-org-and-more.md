We’ve got an exciting how-to session set up for next week’s Mambo Merge Office Hours!
With the Mambo Merge Spring ’24 Release live, it’s the perfect time for Mambo Merge users to brush up on their skills with a speedy demo of updated functionality at our upcoming installment of [Mambo Merge ‘Office Hours](https://cloud.news.mambomerge.app/officehours)’!
In next week’s webinar, our expert presenter Cynthia will be showcasing some new features added to our upcoming release 2.3.0. These features will allow you to include watermarks to your generated documents that get converted to PDF through our Mambo Studio. You’ll have the ability to change the font, size, angle, and color of your watermark for each template used.
On top of that, you will be able to set password protection for these files to add another layer of security before sending sensitive documents out to clients. Our existing PDF capability will get a much-needed boost by providing the ability to PDF preview individual record-generated documents on batch merges.

For those already using our App we “Thank You” and look forward to connecting once again. We encourage you to join as these new features and functionality may be suitable to existing or new use cases for your document-generating needs.
The session will take place on Thursday, February 22nd at 10:00 am (PT), and you can sign up using [this link right now](https://cloud.news.mambomerge.app/officehours)!
If you can’t make it, but still have a question (or have a complicated question that you think we might want some time to consider), go ahead and [toss it on the form here](https://forms.gle/xhg2uwkCjk5zmN1ZA) and we’ll be sure to address it on the call and email you back with the answer too (if you’d like)!
If you haven’t already done so you’ll want to install [Mambo Merge](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxListingDetail?listingId=a0N3u00000MBinOEAT) ahead of time as well, so grab a free, up-to-date edition from the [AppExchange](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxListingDetail?listingId=a0N3u00000MBinOEAT) (or ask an admin too) and we’ll look forward to seeing you there!
Until then, keep working hard, smart, and happy. We’ll see you in the cloud.

Our Trailblazer journey takes us over to the city of Providence, RI. Where we explore their convention center located on Sabin street. Here, [Northeast Dreamin’](https://northeastdreamin.com/) will take place on April 28th and 29th. This in-person event is built around Salesforce learning, growing network relationships, and having fun. Connect with other Trailblazers and explore the exhibit hall to check out all the sponsors who contributed to this event. Make sure to pick up your badge at the front registration along with any goodies they have in-store for attendees. Find out what breakout sessions you plan on adding to your schedule and be sure to allocate some time for the keynote speakers. Lastly, don’t forget to check out the demo jam and welcome ceremony towards the end of the first day! Agenda with full details for both days can be seen[ here](https://northeastdreamin.com/2022-agenda/).

## Stop By Our Booth and Say “Hello!”

While you’re planning out your schedule make sure you allocate some time to visit the Mambo Merge booth along with all the other sponsors. Why, you ask? Well, it’s simple. We have collaborated with NED and other sponsors to bring you a prize-packed Bingo activity in which attendees will have a chance to win some pretty cool stuff!. Learn more about the activity[ here](https://events.mkpartners.com/SponsorBingoCardParticipationAndRestrictions). (And keep an eye out on social media for more information.)
Lastly, all attendees will receive three months of [Mambo Merge](https://www.mambomerge.com/) PRO edition for FREE which unlocks all the features you need in order to make document generation within Salesforce simple, seamless and secure. Generate documents at the push of a button, and you can get started today by installing it from the[ AppExchange](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxListingDetail?listingId=a0N3u00000MBinOEAT).
While there you’ll also have the chance to meet some of the team members and ask any and all of your doc-gen-related questions. They’ll be more than happy to assist. And if you’re a Salesforce partner or consultant, be sure to ask about our Partner Program to unlock even more resources for you and your customers!
It’s great to have in-person events back again and we’ll look forward to seeing you there!

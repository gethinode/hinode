This month marked our first ‘Office Hours’ webinar for 2024. We provided a quick beginner’s intro to the app and covered some of the latest features and functionality that are currently available within our latest release on the [AppExchange](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxListingDetail?listingId=a0N3A00000GCzIXUA1).
Cynthia, our expert, and presenter showcased how to use Mambo Merge to create List View buttons to generate documents for one or many multi-document generation use cases by using the Mambo Merge “Studio.” Check out the video and use the time stamps to guide you along the way.

So.. it comes as no surprise that many Developers, Admins, and Users spend a great deal of time configuring their layout for their partners, clients, or themselves. With Mambo Merge we seek to find innovative ways to make sure any processes that involve generating documents for many records at once can be easily achieved while at the same time be modified on the fly.
Our next session will take place on Thursday, February 22nd at 10:00 am (PT). Don’t miss out and sign up today by using [this link](https://cloud.news.mambomerge.app/officehours).

Until then, keep working hard, smart, and happy. We’ll see you in the cloud.

It may still be mid-Winter when you look out the windows but today’s a big day on the road to the Salesforce Spring ’24 Release — Pre-Release org sign ups are live! And then next week we’ll get release notes and that means Spring ’24 is just over the horizon!
As always, we’ll be peppering the countdown to “go live” with another round of our [Release Highlights](https://medium.com/tag/release-highlights) — collecting and collating the important dates and deadlines, perusing the release notes to gather the most exciting and important updates headed to orgs everywhere, and ensuring that you and your team can hit the ground running once Spring ’24 launches!
So what do we know so far?
We know today’s the first day to [sign up for Spring ’24 pre-Release orgs](https://www.salesforce.com/form/signup/prerelease-spring24/?_ga=2.246972419.642675683.1702330516-36364946.1695837869&_gl=1*1fsvvvc*_ga*MzYzNjQ5NDYuMTY5NTgzNzg2OQ..*_ga_EE9XB9ZV8F*MTcwMjU5MzY0Ni4xLjAuMTcwMjU5MzY0Ni4wLjAuMA..)! (aka pre-Release Developer Edition Environments, aka a sandbox environment “which is full of all the Spring ’24 features to explore to your heart’s content”)!
Also, if you already had a pre-release org for Winter ’24, you can [log back into that one](https://na81.salesforce.com/).
We also know the Go-Live dates, aka Release Weekends, for Spring ’24 are:

<ul><li>January 12, 2024</li><li>February 2, 2024</li><li>February 9, 2024</li></ul>And, given previous releases we can make an educated guess that the January date will be a “**First Release Weekend (Limited, Pilot participation)” **with the remaining February dates being the wider releases that see all orgs get the update!
And we know the rest of the dates [listed here](https://admin.salesforce.com/blog/2023/admin-spring-24-release-dates-countdown) (and below)!

So, go ahead and mark your calendars for “go live” and follow us here for more release info as we get closer. You know we’re excited to get our hands on the release notes and, once we do, we’ll have our regularly scheduled rounds highlighting the new features, functionality, upgrades, and updates that we’re most looking forward to as we count down the days ‘til ‘Spring ‘24’.
As always, if you’d like to have a more in-depth or personalized/focused discussion about what Spring ’24 will mean for your org, or want to do some org maintenance / workflow management pre-release so you can dash into Spring ’24 agile and ready to grow — [drop us a line](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxConsultingListingDetail?listingId=a0N30000001gF9jEAE)! We’re always happy to help.
Until next time, keep working hard, smart, and happy. And we’ll see you in the cloud.

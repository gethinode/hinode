Today we continue our series of speedy interviews with the staff of MK Partners by checking in with certified Salesforce Administrator Mark DeMeo!
I sat down with Mark to chat about his experiences working in the Salesforce ecosystem and specifically on a range of projects at MK Partners. We also dove into his favorite features from the Winter ’21 Salesforce Release and the upgrades and updates he’s most looking forward to next month when Spring ’21 goes live!

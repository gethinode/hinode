As always, in the lead-up to launch, we'll be reading over the release notes and rounding up the highlights that we're most excited to see in our orgs (and our clients'). So let's get started!

## Enable Einstein Opportunity Scoring with Less Data

As a Salesforce Einstein Champion, I'll admit I get a little more excited than the average user over updates to Salesforce's Artificial Intelligence systems --- so of course I'm looking forward to this.

Thanks to the rollout of global scoring models, Einstein Opportunity Scoring is [getting more accurate](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_sales_einstein_opportunity_scoring.htm&type=5&release=230), even for firms just entering the Salesforce ecosystem or without enough of their own data to generate meaningful scoring conclusions. Global scoring models are essentially anonymized aggregated data from across independent Salesforce orgs so, if your own org lacks enough data to generate a scoring model, Einstein will reference the global model to deliver more accurate scoring and help you get underway, right away.

And, once your org has enough data of it's own, Einstein will switch to using your own, personalized prediction/scoring model, to align Einstein even more with the specifics of your business!

This should be a huge boon to smaller companies, those new to Salesforce, or new to the particular Salesforce objects they'd like to leverage AI against and it will be an opportunity for Salesforce themselves to leverage their huge customer base across several industries, ecosystems, and use-cases. It will be a great way to jump right into using Artificial Intelligence and lean on the machine aspect of machine-learning to fine-tune the execution as you operate.

The Spring '21 release will be hitting orgs everywhere [by February 12th](https://admin.salesforce.com/blog/2020/admin-release-countdown-get-ready-for-spring-21), so be sure to check out the [release notes](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_general.htm&type=5&release=230) and stay tuned here for more release highlights as the big day gets closer! And, as always, if you want to a more in-depth discussion about a particular feature, to get a personalized look at what the release will mean for your org, or have other configuration, customization, and execution questions --- [drop us a line](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxConsultingListingDetail?listingId=a0N30000001gF9jEAE)! We're always happy to help.

Until next time, keep working hard, smart, and happy. And we'll see you in the cloud.

It’s officially May and, maybe for the first time in 21 years, we made it through the end of April without seeing a thousand gifs of Justin Timberlake singing “it’s gonna be May”! That also means it’s time for a brand new [MK Partners’ Giveaway](https://gleam.io/HO4VM/mk-partners-may-giveaway)! The contest is open now and we’ve kept in the expanded entry options from last month.
And again, at the end of the month, 1 lucky winner will get a Google Home Mini and the bragging rights to claim they’re May’s luckiest entrant!
There are lots of ways to enter, and you can do one (or all of them) right now, just [click the link](https://gleam.io/HO4VM/mk-partners-may-giveaway) below to get started:

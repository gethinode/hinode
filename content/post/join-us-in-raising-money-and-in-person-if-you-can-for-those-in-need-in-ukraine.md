As School kicks back off and Summer winds down, the media’s attention has drifted away from the ongoing calamity in Ukraine. But, with a war still being waged and local support more important than ever, we’re teaming up with Salesforce and ixlayer to host a [fundraiser](https://www.heartsforukraine.us/salesforceevent), raffle, and donation opportunity for everyone that would like to help.

The safest way for us to help save lives is to align with an organization that has the expertise to do so. Enter Hearts for Ukraine. The mission is simple; deliver critical supplies directly to hospitals, shelters, schools, orphanages, nursing homes, refugee support centers, and the territorial defense forces of Ukraine. Targeted deliveries are made without wasting time on storing non-essential goods.

While the situation is serious & the intentions are good, we also wanted to make sure we were offering something that would help incentivize more donations. So join us on the rooftop of [Hotel Via](https://www.hotelviasf.com/) on September 1st, when friends, family, & colleagues come together to show our support for Ukraine with a goal of raising $100,000! Heavy apps and an open bar are hosted, with 100% of the proceeds going directly to the Hearts for Ukraine foundation.

And, attention all Salesforce employees! All donations/ticket purchases over $50 will be matched and Salesforce will reach out after the event date to confirm the match. No action is needed from employees at this time to ensure the match.

[Full details](https://www.heartsforukraine.us/salesforceevent) of the event can be found [here](https://www.heartsforukraine.us/salesforceevent).

Tickets can be purchased [here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/help-ukraine-fundraising-event-tickets-380345813567).

And, if you’d like to help but won’t be able to make it out to San Francisco, you can also [donate directly right here](https://secure.givelively.org/donate/grains-of-good-foundation/help-ukraine-hearts-for-ukraine-salesforce-ixlayer-fundraising-event).

We appreciate your help and we’re looking forward to seeing you in San Francisco!

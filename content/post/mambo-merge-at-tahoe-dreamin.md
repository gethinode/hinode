Next week will see the return of Salesforce Trailblazers to one of the most special (and scenic) annual events for the CRM and its community — [Tahoe Dreamin’](https://www.norcaldreamin.com/).

Those of you in the ecosystem for a while might still refer to it as NorCal Dreamin’ and, unlike Dreamforce, Connections, TrailheaDX, etc… — one of the things that makes [Tahoe Dreamin’](https://www.norcaldreamin.com/) so special is that it’s a community event! By trailblazers, for trailblazers, and a unique opportunity to gain insight from all levels of Salesforce access and experience.

While official Salesforce events are a great place to learn about upcoming functionality and hear inspiring stories of success, community events like Tahoe Dreamin’ give you an opportunity to dive into the nitty gritty. Hear and see what works, what doesn’t, and get innovative ideas for new approaches to your projects from those on the ground who’ve tackled similar scopes in their own orgs.

And this year, [Mambo Merge](https://www.mambomerge.com/) is a sponsor! The ideal solution for instantly transforming your Salesforce data into documents, to save you the cutting and pasting, tab swapping, and time. Best of all, unlike other mail merge systems, with Mambo Merge your data never has to leave Salesforce. No third-party servers means your data’s secure — and you know IT loves to hear that.

And, if you’d like to get a jumpstart on doc gen in your org, give [Mambo Merge a try today](https://www.mambomerge.com/)! It’s available directly from [the site](https://www.mambomerge.com/), or on the [AppExchange](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxListingDetail?listingId=a0N3u00000MBinOEAT).

Until Tahoe, keep working hard, smart, and happy — we’ll see you in the cloud.

One of Salesforce’s biggest strengths as a platform has always been its ability to be adapted, customized, configured, and built-on to develop a system that perfectly matches each organization’s needs. And, while the reviews and testimonials speak for themselves, a lot of people are still curious to see that “construction” in action — so we’re launching a video series!

Starting next Friday, August 14th, we’ll be doing a series of livestreams that walk through building a Salesforce App or Component from concept to completion. In three weekly, one-hour sessions we’ll go from “brainstorming” to “shipped” so you can get an inside look at everything that goes into giving your org some new functionality.

The first episode will be a roundtable where we pitch each other on potential projects, select one to move forward with, and then ask and answer all the questions we’ll need to get started. Episode two will be actually building out the pieces we need and putting them all together. And the final episode will be testing, troubleshooting, and going live!

You can add all three episodes to your calendars right now if you want to tune in live [Episode 1, Episode 2, Episode 3] and, if you can’t make it, they’ll be available after the stream on our YouTube channel (so be sure to subscribe)!

Feel free to toss your own ideas in the comments below if there’s something specific you’d like to see built out and, if you or your org need a little more assistance making your vision a reality, drop us a line! We’re always happy to help.

Until then, keep working hard, smart, and happy. We’ll see you in the cloud.

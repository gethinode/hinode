We’re back with another installment of our series: “[Q &amp; A with Matt K!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeemI_7c3kA)”.
In this series, Matt sits down weekly to tackle Salesforce questions from the community — unrehearsed and unedited to demonstrate what it looks like when we encounter, evaluate, troubleshoot, and resolve real-world issues and use-cases.
This time, in the [#Formulas](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/formulas) group, a Trailblazer asked how to craft a formula for calculating a score based on the values of two fields on a record. They shared their (lengthy) initial endeavor, and Matt walks us through both the solution, and some refactoring to make the formula even more efficient!

Give it a watch!
Or jump to the [question here on the Trailblazer Community](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/trailblazer-community/feed/0D54V00007Z9yEUSAZ) for the answer!
And if you’ve got a question you’d like Matt to answer, leave it in the comments here so we can add it to a future video or [click this link and fill out our Q&amp;A form](https://go.mkp.dev/Q&A)!
Until next time, keep working hard, smart, and happy. And we’ll see you in the cloud!

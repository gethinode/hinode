We’re back with another installment of our series: “[Q &amp; A with Matt K!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeemI_7c3kA)”.
In this series, Matt sits down weekly to tackle Salesforce questions from the community — unrehearsed and unedited to demonstrate what it looks like when we encounter, evaluate, troubleshoot, and resolve real-world issues and use-cases.
This time, in the [#Formulas](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/formulas) group, a Trailblazer asked how to craft a formula for calculating a score based on the values of two fields on a record. They shared their (lengthy) initial endeavor, and Matt walks us through both the solution, and some refactoring to make the formula even more efficient!

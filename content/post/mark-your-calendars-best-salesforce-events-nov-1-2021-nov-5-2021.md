I may be out on vacation, but these events sure aren’t! In fact this week and next week has some fun conferences and summits in store for you! So sit back, open up your calendars, and let’s get planning!
Now if you are participating in the UN SD goals, then you probably have heard the acronym “ESG” tossed around a lot. Well in [](https://www.globalcompactusa.org/events-and-webinars/expanding-the-g-in-esg), speakers will expand on conventional governance, sustainable governance, and global governance. Taking place on Tuesday, November 2nd at 1pm (EDT), this hour long webinar will also demonstrate the new tool to help achieve the “SDG 16 Business Framework: Inspiring Transformal Governance.” This tool helps strengthen business culture, ethics, and performance, and supports public institutions, laws, and systems. As someone who has used the WEP tool from the UN SD goals to assist with gender equality in the workplace, I can validate that these tools are very useful!
The remaining events of the week are occurring on Thursday, November 4th. Starting at 1pm (BST, so super early here), viewers will hear how to [](https://www.salesforce.com/uk/form/sfdo/edu/app-exchange-webinar/?_ga=2.18319929.1262993345.1635270073-1449393581.1625164245). The four apps being previewed in this webinar will show viewers how to help with advanced course scheduling, view ongoing virtual events, show intelligent video experience to keep students engaged, and ways to give students a better contact center experience.
Then at a more appropriate time of day aka 9am (PDT), the [](https://www.salesforce.com/form/events/webinars/form-rss/3419078)\*\* \*\*is going to teach sales teams how to attract and retain top talent. We are all aware that the economy has shifted and with the world opening up, hiring right now is competitive and employees are leaving their jobs in the masses. And in order to obtain and keep this talent, you need to arm your sales managers with tools and resources that make a positive impact. In this virtual session, not only will you learn that, but also how to ramp up reps quickly, provide meaningful insights and coaching, and scale best practices.
We are rounding out our week with a half day summit! Momentive, formally known as Survey Monkey, is hosting [](https://www.getfeedback.com/cx-impact-summit-2021/?utm_source=sfmc&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=GFP_DG_AH&utm_content=6403&date=2021-10-26&CID=158057031&CampaignId=6403) also starting at 9am (PDT). The point of this conference is to influence and deliver a better customer experience. This is the 2nd annual conference, and even though it may be new, they have big names like Trevor Noah and Serena Willams as guest speakers! There will be 7 sessions with over a dozen guest speakers, including Natalie Roberts from Salesforce! I think we should all tune in to see what this event is about!

For those of us who participate in the United Nations Sustainable Goals, we learned last week how and why water is essential for business resilience, and how climate change is causing a water crisis in **Delivering on Net-Positive Water Impact for Growth and Resilience**. We had another **Skill Up on Slack: Workflow Builder** to talk about automating workflows without needing code. Google had their **Google Cloud North American Partner Forum** for all of their partners to come together and finish the year strong and inspired.
I also found out last week that **ParDreamin’** aka Pardot Dreamin’ was an actual event, and was a 3 day long event filled with over 60 sessions, dozens of speakers, and even pre-conference workshops the day before. We had 2 in-person Dreamin’ events: **Tahoe Dreamin’** and **Florida Dreamin’**! How did it feel to connect in-person with other Trailblazers in your community? What was your favorite session or who was your favorite speaker?
Tweet us [@mkpartners](http://www.twitter.com/mkpartners) and let us know what your favorite event was! Also, make sure to [let us know](xchange.salesforce.com/appxConsultingListingDetail?listingId=a0N30000001gF9jEAE) if you think there are any events worth mentioning and what event you are excited about this upcoming week. And, as always, we will see you in the cloud!

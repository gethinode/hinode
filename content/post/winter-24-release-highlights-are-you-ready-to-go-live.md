Dreamforce has come and gone, along with Release Readiness sessions for both [Admin](https://www.salesforce.com/plus/experience/dreamforce_2023/series/administrators_at_dreamforce_2023/episode/episode-s1e3) and [Developers](https://www.salesforce.com/plus/experience/dreamforce_2023/series/developers_at_dreamforce_2023/episode/episode-s1e3). These included an explanation of top features from the Winter ’24 release along with live demos and Q&amp;A from product experts. In case you didn&#39;t have a chance to tune in go ahead and check them out on Salesforce+ with the links above.
And right here we continue our coverage of our [Release Highlights](https://medium.com/creme-de-la-crm/releasehighlights/home) by wrapping up some of the final steps left before every org has access to the newest features in their production environment.
All episodes of the Release Readiness Live sessions will be available on [Salesforce+](https://www.salesforce.com/plus/experience/release_readiness_live/series/release_readiness_live_winter_24) to watch. These include both Dreamforce sessions (Admin / Developer) followed by the [two-day event](https://www.salesforce.com/plus/experience/release_readiness_live) that covers the additional four (Sales / CRM Analytics / Service / Flow). Then a final wrap-up session that includes the best highlights of all combined.

These should be available later this week or first thing next week. So, grab some popcorn, a snack, or your favorite treat, and check them out.
If you still have questions or need additional assistance getting answers pertaining to this release head over to the [Release Readiness Trailblazers](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/trailblazer-community/groups/0F9300000001okuCAA) and ask away. They’ve helped me in the past and are a tremendous resource to help point you in the right direction to get a better understanding of features hitting orgs in the coming weeks.

Last but not least make sure you know when these features will be live in your org by using the helpful [Maintenance Calendar](https://status.salesforce.com/products/all/maintenances) to find your org and its release date! The last two Release weekends take place on the 6th and 13th of next month. So every org has about two weeks before the release goes live. So, make these next few weeks count to ensure everyone is ready for the changes coming their way.

Share with us what caught your attention during these Release Readiness sessions or what features you look forward to implementing for your users and customers.
Until the next time, keep working hard, smart, and happy. And we’ll see you in the cloud!

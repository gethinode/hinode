And they’re international, so you’ll have opportunities on both sides of the pond to learn from peers, expand your network, and get inspired to be your best!

These 1–3 day conferences are created by the community, for the community, and offer some of the best opportunities to grow professionally (at, often, more affordable prices than the big “official” events like Dreamforce).

Let’s dive in to July!

## Forcelandia (2-Day Event)

**Portland, OR**
_Wednesday, July 11 — Thursday, July 12_
[Forcelandia ](https://quickto.click/Forcelandia) bills itself as “your favorite Salesforce Developer-Oriented Community Event”, though they welcome those who build with clicks or with code, so architects, devs, automators, and admins can all find value in attendance.

This year will be the 8th Forcelandia at the Kennedy School in Portland.

## [Midwest Dreamin’](https://quickto.click/MWDreamin) (3-Day Event)

**Minneapolis, MN**
**Wednesday, July 17 — Friday, July 19** Can you believe it&#39;s been a decade since Eric “[](https://quickto.click/theDresh)” Dreshfield (founder and contributor) along with a handful of Trailblazers first put this event together? It has grown to become one of the most anticipated Salesforce community conferences in the US!

Its 10th anniversary takes place July 17–19 at the Hyatt Regency in Minneapolis. Hundreds of attendees from all across the United States (and beyond) will travel to attend, learn, demo, and enjoy the festivities.
[Registration is available here](https://quickto.click/MWDReg).

## [London’s Calling](https://quickto.click/LondonsCalling) (1-Day Event)

**London, UK**
**Wednesday, July 19**It’s only one day long, but it’s already a fan-favorite overseas event. [London’s Calling](https://quickto.click/LondonsCalling) returns this year with just shy of ten hours of activities (excluding extra-curriculars and after-parties).
Almost ‘Salesforce World Tour’-scale, London’s Calling holds the claim as the largest Community-led event in the Salseforcephere with over 700 in-person attendees in 2022 — it also features an online attendance options for those that can’t make the trip to London.

## [Tahoe Dreamin](https://quickto.click/TahoeDreamin) (2-Day Event)

**South Lake Tahoe, NV**
**Thursday, July 25 — Friday, July 26**This annual community-led Salesforce conference is held in Harrah’s Lake Tahoe, on the border of California and Nevada. Organized by members of the Salesforce community, it’s designed to provide attendees with opportunities to learn, network, and share best practices.
{{< image src="/img/1_ODPvHgIJWzhJPPhp0WcRbQ.png" title="Image" >}}

This is a staple event if you are on the West Coast as SoCal and NorCal residents can quickly fly or drive on in, and ditto for NV residents. It’s also one of the closest Community events to Salesforce HQ (and arguably one of the most naturally beautiful with the lakes and mountains as a backdrop), and so often features interesting and exciting guests from Salesforce and silicon-valley.
If you’re flying however, you’ll want to make sure to plan your trip from the airport to the event as you’ll likely be flying into Reno and then shuttling or renting a car. Or you can always try to find a carpool buddy in the community!
[Tahoe Dreamin](https://quickto.click/TahoeDreamin) is also known for typically offering an array of evening activities, often provided by sponsors or just groups of friendly Trailblazers saying “Who’s hungry? We’re all going to...” which can help you meet other attendees, enjoy the scenery, and share new experiences. If you haven’t attended before, I highly recommend it.
Their “2024 Special Deal” makes this event harder to resist as attendees who register now will get an additional $100 off their 2025 registration (when it comes out).
To sweeten the deal you can [use our code: ](https://quickto.click/TahoeReg) and get an additional $25 off their registration.

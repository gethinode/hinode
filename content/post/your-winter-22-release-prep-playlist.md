If you haven’t already read through [the release notes](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.salesforce_release_notes.htm&type=5&release=234) and kept up with [the highlights](https://medium.com/creme-de-la-crm/tagged/winter-22-release), this is your last chance to really do some prep before your more connected users start asking questions about new features, updates, and upgrades!

Luckily, Salesforce is again making it easy for admins and devs everywhere to get a crash course in the most significant improvements with another handy, helpful trailhead module — [Winter ’22 release highlights](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/content/learn/modules/winter-22-release-highlights)!

You can log into your trailhead account, navigate to the module, and earn your Winter ’22 release badge right now!
The trails are broken out by product and use-case to make it easy to just hit the highlights that are most relevant to you and your org (if you don’t feel like earning the entire badge).

In [sales](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/content/learn/modules/winter-22-release-highlights/whats-new-sales-winter-22), you’ll see how Pipeline Inspection Enhancements use new AI-powered close date predictions to see which sales opportunities are most and least likely to close within each month.

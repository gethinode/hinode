[Tahoe Dreamin](https://tahoedreamin.com/)’ is definitely one of the most beautiful locations for a Salesforce community conference, nestled in the Sierra Nevada mountains overlooking California and Nevada’s shared lake — but this year it’s got a new admirer: your wallet! Or your company’s.
In fact, this may be the most affordable year for TD yet! Conference passes are already priced at a super reasonable $199 and, we’re super excited to announce, you can save an extra $25 with the promo code <strong>cremedelacrm25</strong> !
That knocks full [registration](https://tahoedreamin.com/register/) down to $175 for full conference access and, with hotels still as low as $69/night, it may be the best chance (and excuse) to get up to Tahoe Dreamin for a while!

While Dreamforce was full of future feature and product announcements, we still have many more updates and upgrades headed our way during the two remaining Winter ’24 Release Weekends. In this Release Highlights, we’ll focus on pointing out some of the general enhancements coming to the platform this Winter!

## Improved UI Elements

The [first one](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_general_color_contrast.htm&release=246&type=5) comes in the form of non-text and text UI elements such as buttons, checkboxes, and links which will now display in color contrast to align with accessibility standards. These changes started during Summer ’23 Release and have been refined for Winter ’24 to comply with WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) which works on making sure all the color contrasts used on every web page can seen by all users on all devices and under any lighting condition.

Although these changes may seem subtle at first, they impact everyone and are continuously improving as new discoveries are made to improve the user experience — something Salesforce aims to achieve with each and every new Release update.

## Quick Actions on Related Lists

The [next one](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_customization_general_related_list_quick_actions_ga.htm&release=246&type=5) revolves around making Admin’s workload easier when it comes to creating Quick Actions within Related Lists for their users. The workaround prior to this update consisted of adding quick actions within the highlights panel of page layouts which impacted the user experience based on who had access.
This update removes the need to tinker around with page layouts and provides a simple way to slot in quick actions, using an actions bar, by editing a lightning page. Choose from Standard or Custom Actions and customize the look and feel of each Related List.

Simply enter the number of actions to display within a Related list and define each action within the properties. Improve user interactions while making Admin work more productive.

## Setting Expiration Dates to Salesforce Files

This [next one](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_experiences_files_publiclink.htm&release=246&type=5) comes in the form of sharing and security protocols. As you may or may not be aware, by default and prior to this update, public link sharing for Salesforce files is enabled and defaults to 30 days. Well, with this enhancement you will now be able to set a specific duration of days along with a password required (which is auto-generated).

Simply head over to your org’s home page and configure the settings within the **Content Deliveries and Public Links**.

## Disabled Keyboard Shortcuts

Looks like many have asked about having [this enhancement](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_general_disable_keyboard_shortcuts.htm&release=246&type=5) and their voices have been heard. By default, Salesforce shortcuts are enabled and can become a nuisance if working with multiple programs outside the Salesforce platform. That is why starting Winter ’24 the user experience can be accommodated to those who wish to disable it, period. Simply head over to the **Help Menu** and click on **View Keyboard Shortcuts** to toggle the on/off option.

## What To Expect

With the Release Weekends rapidly approaching expect input and feedback for Trailblazers who’ve started to have some time to test drive these features firsthand. Keep an eye out for new findings on some of these changes and prepare your users for changes that will affect their daily org operations.

Keep us posted on your findings, share with us what caught your attention, and we’ll be happy to cover it in more depth here on the blog! Until next time, keep working hard, smart, and happy.

And we’ll see you in the cloud!

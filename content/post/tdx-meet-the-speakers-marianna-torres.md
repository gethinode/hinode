[TDX](https://go.mkp.dev/TDXPromo) is less than a week away and we’re back with another round of “Meet-the-Speakers” to help you get your TDX [Agenda](https://reg.salesforce.com/flow/plus/tdx24/sessioncatalog/page/Catalog?_ga=2.234547870.1609681575.1708463141-2031003552.1708103214&tab.day=20240306) locked in!
With over 200 sessions to choose from, we figured it might be helpful to sit down with some speakers, learn a bit about what they’ll be presenting, and ask them a few TDX-themed questions — while they’re in the spotlight.
This time we sat down with [Marianna Torres](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mariannatorres/) from Salesforce Labs who’s leading what should be an amazing session for admins, devs, and anybody who’s got a vision for more functionality in their org: [](https://go.mkp.dev/Apps4Admins)!

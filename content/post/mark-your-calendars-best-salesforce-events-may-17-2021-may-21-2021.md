Phew we have another week filled with so many events that I only wrote about a few! I recommend pursuing all the different Salesforce event links to see if there is anything else you want to attend. It’s a very productive week in the Salesforce ecosystem, so I recommend you sit back, open up your calendar, and get planning!
Starting the week off, we are learning [](https://www.salesforce.com/form/events/webinars/form-rss/3144203) on Tuesday, May 18th at 9am (PDT). This webinar is focused for those in marketing, however I recommend anyone in sales attend it too! You’ll hear how you can reach prospects of any size and convert them to customers, tactics to deliver high quality leads, and how the marketing automation tool helps you with this from start to finish. This is a great way to get on your grind for the week!
The Sacramento, Ca Salesforce User group is hosting [](https://trailblazercommunitygroups.com/events/details/salesforce-salesforce-user-group-sacramento-united-states-presents-byof-build-your-own-flow-make-flow-builder-your-new-bff/)\*\* **on Wednesday, May 19th at 4pm (PDT). In this group meeting, the speaker will be demonstrating how flows can solve multiple cases. This is a hands-on workshop, so you’ll need to sign up for Trailhead and create a new playground to follow along with the speaker. There will also be prizes for those who participate and they will wrap up the meeting by planning for the next one.
Then the Irvine, Ca Salesforce Marketer (Pardot) group is hosting a [](https://trailblazercommunitygroups.com/events/details/salesforce-salesforce-marketer-group-pardot-irvine-united-states-presents-workshop-how-to-build-a-pardot-email-engagement-dashboard-in-salesforce/)**.** Occurring on Thursday, May 20th at 12pm (PDT) the speakers will take you step by step through campaigns and reporting to create a Pardot email engagement dashboard. It doesn’t matter if you are using B2BMA or Pardot, you will get tips and tricks on how to get all of these new possibilities!
For this next event I’m sacrificing my boss, Matt Kaufman, to represent MK Partners. The Santa Moncia, CA Salesforce User group is hosting a [](https://trailblazercommunitygroups.com/events/details/salesforce-salesforce-admin-group-santa-monica-united-states-presents-salesforce-trivia/) and if you know my boss, he has been a part of the Salesforce ecosystem since 2002 and he practically knows everything about it. (He also loves trivia and a challenge). This event is happening on Saturday, May 22nd at 12pm (PDT) and they will be playing this game on Kahoot, so make sure to download the app. Also, they are giving away some swag!
Our last event of the week is also happening on Saturday. **A\*\*[](https://sfalbania.al/) will be in-person this year, yes you read that right, but there will be limited seating and they will be following all covid related protocols. All of the speakers are speaking virtually and if you can’t attend, don’t worry, there will be a live stream broadcast during the event that will continue to run for 24 hours. For those of you who don’t know what this event is about or for, well it’s an event to address global technology innovation and is for developers, admins, and architects! On the site it says you can buy tickets, but it’s free if you are attending virtually! If you want more information for probably the first in-person event I’ve written about, well head to their Facebook page, as that has more updates and information than their website.

Last week every event happened on a Thursday!! What was so special about that particular Thursday, I don’t even know. But what I do know is that we had a lot of solid events!
The **Success Anywhere World Tour** talked about how Trailblazers use the Salesforce platform and wrapped up the event with a musical guest. Next, **Combatting Digital Event Fatigue in 2021** taught attendees (and me) how to keep their employees, and customers engaged with virtual events. Businesses learned how to keep customers coming back for more in **How Subscriptions are Driving Revenue Resilience**.
We heard from one of the most known management speakers in **Unlearn &amp; Rethink: A Conversation on Leadership with Adam Grant,** where he talked about the power of unlearning and rethinking. We got a joint meeting that covered both the Summer ’21 Releases and updates about TrailheaDX in the **Salt Lake City/ Utah County Admin Group Joint Meeting**. Finally, **The best things in life are… (Virtual)** shared all of the free things you can do in Salesforce in a coffee-style type of share and tell discussion. Tweet us [@mkpartners](http://www.twitter.com/mkpartners) and let us know what your favorite event was!
Also, make sure to [let us know](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxConsultingListingDetail?listingId=a0N30000001gF9jEAE&utm_source=mkp&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=logigear-mkp-tpp) if you think there are any events worth mentioning and what event you are excited about this upcoming week. And, as always, we will see you in the cloud!

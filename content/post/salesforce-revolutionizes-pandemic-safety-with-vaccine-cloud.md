The COVID-19 pandemic has rewritten the rulebook on events, workplaces, and operations overall — giving rise to the digital HQ and giving us all some surprising experience and insight into the realm of testing, vaccination, and managing medical records and data.
With clients of all sizes, across every industry and vertical, Salesforce was in a unique position to quickly deliver a solution to organizations, clinical providers, and public health agencies to manage their needs around the pandemic and the safety of their communities.
[Vaccine Cloud](https://www.salesforce.com/products/vaccine-cloud/overview/) was developed as an on-platform solution for manage proof of COVID-19 health status including COVID-19 vaccination and test results to help follow health guidelines and plan safer in person experiences. It also transforms vaccine administration for governments, healthcare providers, nonprofits, and organizations.

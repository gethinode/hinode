This week we had the opportunity to volunteer with the Salesforce Healthcare and Life Sciences Team in Irvine and, with our combined forces, support the local community in Orange County!
[Second Harvest Food Bank](https://feedoc.org/) strives to provide access to delicious and nutritious fruits and vegetables to provide healthy foods for Orange County families and the community. They work hard and dedicate their resources, from all teams, to ensure everything is possible and provide nutritious food to those who need it most.
We had the opportunity to work alongside one of their harvesting teams and pick some delicious butternut squash. These vegetables are rich in nutrients, antioxidants and support immune health to maintain better skin, eyes, and digestion.
Many Trailblazers took time out of their busy schedules to support a greater cause. Our instructor provided clear and precise instructions along with some handy tools to begin our journey. Our combined forces were split into teams as we tackled various sections within the field. From left to right we quickly picked up a rhythm and were able to harvest hundreds of these delicious vegetables!

As tempting as they may seem, these veggies still need more sunlight in order to properly ripen to perfection. So, they will lay low in the field for a few more days after removing them from their stems. Soon, they will be picked up, sent out, and distributed to the community!
We thank everyone who was able to make the trip as people from San Francisco, San Diego, the Valley, and in between were able to make the trip! Trailblazers committed to making change and giving back to their communities is what the Salesforce HLS Team, MK Partners, and the Pledge 1% program are all about.

In the coming weeks, the food bank will begin preparations for planting winter vegetables and fruits as they strive to plant and harvest 365 days a year. They welcome and are always looking for volunteers so, if you’d like your organization to Pledge 1%, consider them as an effective and inspiring [volunteer opportunity.](https://feedoc.volunteerhub.com/vv2/)
In the meantime, keep working hard, smart, and happy. We’ll see you in the cloud.

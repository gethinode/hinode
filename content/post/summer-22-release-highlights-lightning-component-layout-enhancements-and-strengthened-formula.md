Dynamic related lists and new formulas help provide additional ways for Admins to solve problems.

{{< image src="/img/0_Nz2uEoh1u10SHrvn.png">}}

Three times a year, every year, [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/) releases updates to its products and services (the Winter, Spring and Summer releases)! As an admin, having a release strategy can help your users, colleagues, and partners hit the ground running with any changes to existing products and services as well as take full advantage of new products, features and functionality! Helpful resources such as the [Trailhead release strategy](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/sf_releases) give you the checklist needed to prepare for the release. [Salesforce Help](https://help.salesforce.com/s/) is also an additional resource to gather specific details about past and present releases.

Lastly, you can connect with the community group for [Readiness Release Trailblazers](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/trailblazer-community/groups/0F9300000001okuCAA) in order to stay up to date on the latest enhancements and innovations! As always, when there’s a new release on the way, we’ve hand-picked a few features that stand out to us, broken them down and highlighted how they’ll affect or improve some common use-cases and practices.

Let’s dive in!

### Component Layout Enhancements

First up is the introduction of Dynamic Related Lists within the App Builder. This improvement helps setup and build apps quicker by adding, removing, reordering and sorting related list actions without having to use the page layout. Admins can customize lists by adding filters to display only what they need to see and add multiple lists within the same record to keep track of the information that matters most.

Starting in Summer ’22 Admins will be able to display Opportunity lists within a specific Account with customized filters. The first list could display the most recent closed/won Opportunities while a second Related List could display open Opportunities which are valued greater than $100K. Now each Account can display the information needed to assess and determine a strategy to put into action to create more Opportunities, or close the ones that matter most.

### New Formula Functions

Expand formula fields, validation rules, approval processes, and workflows with more robust date, time, math, and text functions! These additional [18 functions](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_general_new_formula_functions.htm&type=5&release=238) range from retrieving the day, week or year number within a particular date to truncating values to a specific number of digits. Solve trigonometry equations using the sine, cosine and tangent functions or compute more mathematical or physics equations by inserting the pi constant. Format text to title-case by capitalizing the first letter of each word in a string or define a time and date based on the number of seconds elapsed!

Admins will be able to strengthen their formulas with these additional functions to compute, convert, and tackle a wide range of use-case scenarios! Take large scale Opportunity Records and create formulas to identify the number of days and weeks each stage of the opportunity typically takes to complete. Then, update your sales velocity expectations and build a strategy to close/win more opportunities! Or, simplify research and development data by truncating values to a specific set of digits and computing to a desired output.

### Final Thoughts

We feel that dynamic Related Lists will find applicable use-cases within both Standard or Custom Objects, while Automations and Workflows will also benefit from these additional functions. Admins will surely find instances within their Org’s and specific Apps where both of these features will be greatly appreciated.

As always, we’ll keep the Release Highlights rolling as we get closer to launch day and, if there’s something in the Release Notes that caught your eye and you’d like us to cover, feel free to drop it in the comments here!

Until next time, thanks for stopping by and we’ll see you in the cloud!

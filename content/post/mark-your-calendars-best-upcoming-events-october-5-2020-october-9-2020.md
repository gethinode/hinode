Another week, more events. We got a little bit of this and a little bit of that this upcoming week, so sit back, open up your calendar and let’s get planning!
We are going to begin the week by talking about the biggest event of the week. This event is obviously the [](https://www.tableau.com/community/events/conference) that is taking place over multiple days worldwide. The Americas conference is from October 6th through October 8th, while Europe and Asia Pacific is from October 7th through October 9. Every conference is from 9am to 3pm, depending on where you are in the world. Speakers such as John Legend, Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson, Heather McGowan, Marc Rudolph, Ebony Beckwith and many more will be joining the event! Make sure to check out the schedule and register for the event, so you get the most out of it!
For those of you in the UK where the Tableau Conference starts on the 7th, well you are in luck cause the [](https://www.salesforce.com/uk/form/sfdo/edu/horizons-virtual-2020/) event is taking place on Tuesday, October 6th. It begins at 10:30am (BST) and has multiple speakers from different industries and universities, not only from the UK, but from other locations in Europe and the US. Even though this is not an all day event, the program is full of content and topics, so sign up!
Then on Wednesday, October 7th we have 2 Salesforce webinar events. The first taking place at 9am (PST) is [](https://www.salesforce.com/form/events/webinars/form-rss/2709522). For those of you who don’t know, ALM stands for Application Lifecycle Management. The goal of this webinar is to teach you how to use tools and methodologies to build Salesforce related apps. You’ll learn how to utilize your sandbox and use automation testing so that you can release your changes faster.
At 11am [](https://www.salesforce.com/form/events/webinars/form-rss/2705139) is here to talk about Financial Service Cloud for your business. This cloud helps unify businesses across their customer experience, geographies and lines of business on top of having Service and Sales Cloud capabilities. You will get a preview about the product investment areas and hear stories about customer success with Financial Service Cloud.
If you run or are employed by a small or medium sized business, then this event might interest you! [](https://www.salesforce.com/form/events/webinars/form-rss/2699497) is on Thursday, October 8th at 9am (PST). It’s been 6 months since the pandemic and every business has had to pivot (_insert Ross screaming PIVOT anytime this word is mentioned_) and Salesforce has surveyed thousands of small and medium businesses to see how they are evolving. The speaker will be discussing these findings, giving insight and hopefully, you can learn how to leverage that information for your business.
We have a smaller, late night event from the Saltlake City, UT Salesforce Dev group ending the night. At 8pm (MST) in [](https://trailblazercommunitygroups.com/events/details/salesforce-salesforce-developer-group-salt-lake-city-united-states-presents-automation-architecture-pbs-flows-wfrs-apex-triggers/) is hosting 2 speakers from different companies are going to “talk about the pros and cons of different declarative and programmatic automation in Salesforce.” The event goes to about 9:30pm, so no one would blame you if you wore your pjs to this event.
Once again we have a weekend event! [](https://trailblazercommunitygroups.com/events/details/salesforce-salesforce-admin-group-san-ramon-united-states-presents-demystifying-code-for-admins-get-inspired-by-trailblazing-journey-of-adam-winter21-updates/)\*\* \*\*is on Saturday, October 10th at 12:30pm and man do they have a lot of things to talk about!

It’s the first week of Summer ’22 and while we’ve all been busy exploring the release’s new features, updates, and upgrades — it hasn’t slowed down installs of Salesforce’s best doc-gen tool and that means it’s time for another installment of our regular Mambo Merge Office hours session!
Generating documents straight from Salesforce is one of the most powerful ways to transform your data into time-savings for your team — that’s why we built [Mambo Merge](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxListingDetail?listingId=a0N3u00000MBinOEAT). And this year we’ve been making it even easier to get started with a monthly webinar we call [Mambo Merge Office Hours](https://events.mkpartners.com/MamboMergeOfficeHours).
It’s a chance to get a speedy beginner’s intro to the app, get some experience building templates of your own, and to help shape future development and request the new features you’d like to see most!
The session is Thursday, June 9that 10:30am (PT), and you can sign up [right here, right now](https://events.mkpartners.com/MamboMergeOfficeHours)!

You’ll want to install [Mambo Merge](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxListingDetail?listingId=a0N3u00000MBinOEAT) ahead of time as well, so grab a free, up-to-date edition from the [AppExchange](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxListingDetail?listingId=a0N3u00000MBinOEAT) (or ask an admin to) and we’ll look forward to seeing you there!
Until then, keep working hard, smart, and happy. We’ll see you in the cloud.

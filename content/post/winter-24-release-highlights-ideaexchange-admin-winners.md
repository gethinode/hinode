While [Hurriquake’s](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-08-22/ojai-valley-earthquake-tropical-storm-hilary-hurriquake) don’t usually signal the end of Summer (and there’s still technically a whole ‘nother season before the chilliest chunk of the calendar), we’re technically [less than a week away](https://medium.com/creme-de-la-crm/salesforce-winter-24-release-notes-are-live-4fdc92fc2dc4) from the first orgs receiving the Salesforce Winter ’24 Release!

That makes it the perfect time to jump into our next round of [Release Highlights](https://medium.com/creme-de-la-crm/releasehighlights/home), the series where we pore over the release notes, collate, and collect the features, updates. and upgrades that we think will have the biggest impact on admins, devs, and Trailblazers everywhere!

This time we’re back with a couple IdeaExchange winners regarding permission sets that are sure to be a timesaver for admins — let’s dive in!

## See What’s Enabled in a Permission Set More Easily (Beta)

First up, how ‘bout an easy way to get an “at-a-glance” understanding of exactly which permissions are included in a permission set? With Winter ’24 Salesforce is making [managing users’ access and permissions easier](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_permissions_summary_beta.htm&release=246&type=5)! Now you’ll be able to “see all enabled object, user, and field permissions on one page, saving you dozens of clicks. You can also see which permission set groups the permission set is included in”.

That sound you heard was admins everywhere breathing a sigh of relief (probably punctuated by a few, “about time!”s).

## Report on Custom Permission Set and Permission Set Group Assignments

Next up, and in the same vein, the ability to [report on Custom Permission Set and Permission Set Group Assignments](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_permissions_perm_set_crt.htm&release=246&type=5)! No more wondering who’s assigned which permission set or group, or clicking through pages of permissions and users. With Winter ’24 we’ll be able to “create a custom report type and build reports on custom permission set and permission set group assignments. See all users assigned to a specific custom permission set or permission set group. Or, use the report to review an individual user’s assignments”!

Again, another huge win for admins everywhere and a reason to keep your eye on the IdeaExchange and vote for the features nearest and dearest to your use-cases.

## Stay Tuned

Be sure to subscribe, stick around, and stay tuned here as well, because the Winter ’24 release notes are full of wins (including about 15 from the IdeaExchange) and so we’ll be back several times over running through the biggest and best updates and features for admins, devs, and users headed to orgs everywhere! And, if there’s a feature that’s caught your eye that you’d like a deep-dive in, let us know in the comments!

Until next time, keep working hard, smart, and happy. And we’ll see you in the cloud.

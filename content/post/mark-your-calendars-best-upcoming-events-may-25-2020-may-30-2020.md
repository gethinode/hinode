This upcoming week a lot of the Trailblazer community groups are hosting events. Due to the Memorial Day holiday (in the United States anyways) there aren’t any events on Monday, so enjoy your time off! It’s a busy week and we don’t have a lot of time for chit chat, so sit back, open up your calendars and let’s get planning!

If you are new to Salesforce and are an Admin there is [](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/live/) on Friday, May 29th. It’s a good way to meet other new Admins and learn some tips! There are a few of these sessions in the following weeks, but why not get ahead and on your game now?
Do you love apps and want to talk to other people who are just as passionate about apps as you? Well on Friday, March 29th [](https://trailblazercommunitygroups.com/events/details/salesforce-colorado-springs-co-administrators-group-presents-if-youre-appy-and-you-know-it/) is taking place with the [Colorado Springs Administrators Group](https://trailblazercommunitygroups.com/colorado-springs-co-administrators-group/).

## Saturday, May 30th

Rounding out the week is an event that is “scheduled” for May 29th, but it’s actually occurring on the 30th. Now why would I encourage you to attend an event on your Saturday?!

Do you remember how last week had all of those events on Wednesday? We had **Back to Basics: Your Intro into Flow, Connected Campaigns,** and a** Pardot Virtual Happy Hour**! all in one day; did you manage to attend them all?
We also learned about some major donor moves during Portland, Oregon’s **May NPSP Meeting**, and gaining new prospects in **Masterclass: Engaging with Prospects Digitally.**
Then we wrapped up our week with **Moving Towards Mastery: Report and Dashboard Features You Should Know. **Did you attend any of these events or classes? Tweet us [@mkpartners](https://twitter.com/mkpartners) and let us know your thoughts!
Also, make sure to tweet us if you think there are any events worth mentioning and what event you are excited about this upcoming week. And, as always, we’ll see you in the cloud.

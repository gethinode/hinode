Most of the events this week are for those in sales or trying to sell, well… anything. We also address a few other important topics as well. Sorry that I don’t have fun events for you, but it can’t be all fun and games all of the time at Salesforce. So sit back, open up your calendars and let’s get planning!

Starting off the week is an event I wish would have occurred back in March of 2020 when the pandemic started. [Why Every CSR and HR Team Needs a Disaster Relief & Readiness Plan](https://www.salesforce.com/form/sfdo/spc/disaster-relief-webinar/?_ga=2.29666429.338106580.1626971824-1449393581.1625164245) is occurring on Tuesday, July 27th at 10am (PT) and will teach viewers how to be proactive when disaster strikes. I mean between the pandemic, floods, locust invasions, fires, and even alien spotting that happened in 2020, I had to come up with MK Partners contingency plans, and I’m hoping other companies did so as well. During this webinar, viewers will also learn how to create a playbook that HR can activate for the C-level executives and employees, as well as building relationships with other companies and nonprofits to get immediate relief. I’ll more than likely be at this meeting so that I can brush up our own plans.

Then on Wednesday, July 28th at 9am (PT) nonprofits will learn about best practices and special considerations on how to benefit from integrating donation information in Salesforce in I[ntegration Payment Considerations for Nonprofits](https://www.salesforce.com/form/sfdo/ngo/integrated-payment-considerations-for-nonprofits/?_ga=2.29666429.338106580.1626971824-1449393581.1625164245). The 5 key takeaways will range from the importance of fraud monitoring, keeping credit card information up to date, and integrating payments into Salesforce.

Then at 11am (PT) we are covering a topic that addresses the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. If you are a Salesforce partner company, then you are aware that a new pillar requirement was added, and that includes participating with the UN SD goals. Apparently 75% of companies don’t have a climate commitment, even though that is 1 of the 17 SD goals, and is the #1 risk to a growing company. In addition to more stakeholders and clients requiring transparency in ESG reporting, it’s necessary that businesses address this issue ASAP. In [Drive Climate Action with Supply Chain Data](https://www.salesforce.com/form/events/webinars/form-rss/3296648), viewers will learn about supply chain emissions and how they are affecting businesses, learn how Salesforce top clients are addressing the issue, and enable your leadership team with more accurate data. A panel of sustainable champions will also be in attendance to talk about measuring carbon footprints and taking steps to a more sustainable future.

Next on Thursday, July 29th we have [Grow Revenue with a Hybrid B2B Sales Model: The Digitally Powered Sales Team](https://www.salesforce.com/form/events/webinars/form-rss/3315478) at 9am (PT). The event is centered around how selling online will directly impact your sales team and make your customers happy. The guest speakers will talk about their hybrid model to drive higher satisfaction for both their customers and sales teams. Viewers will also get tips on internal buy-ins, changing management, and any concerns your sales team may have.

Ending the week on a similar note, [Consumer Goods and the Great B2B Digital Acceleration](https://www.salesforce.com/form/events/webinars/form-rss/3302694) will focus more on consumer good companies and how they had to pivot to become both digital and face to face in order to serve their customers. Viewers will hear how these companies accelrated their digital investments to drive growth and deliver stronger relationships. Salesforce will also go over the results of their latest survey of global consumer good companies. This event is also on Thursday, July 29th, but at 11am (PT).

As Trailblazers brace for the boy-band-iest of meme weekends (it’s been over ten years since we’ve been able to make the April-to-May transition without seeing Justin Timberlake and N\*Sync cross our feeds), Admins, Devs, and Salesforce users the world over will at least be able to cleanse their palettes with some light reading on the latest and greatest features, updates, and upgrades heading to our orgs this Summer. That’s right, the Salesforce [Summer ’23 Release Notes are live](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.salesforce_release_notes.htm&release=244&type=5)!

As always, we’ll be spending a couple days poring over the release notes, IDing what we think will be the most impactful improvements, the most ROI-driving updates, and the biggest QOL tweaks heading to orgs in May and June so we can build our regular run of [Release Highlights](https://medium.com/creme-de-la-crm/releasehighlights/home) blog posts, videos, and webinars!

And, if you want to get a head start for yourself (or want to request that we do a deep dive into a new feature you and your org are particularly interested in) — now’s your chance!

The [release notes are available right here](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.salesforce_release_notes.htm&release=244&type=5) and, as always, if it’s your first time in the lead up to an SF-release (or you just need a refresher because a lot’s happened since Spring ’23), they’ve produced helpful sections on:

- [How to Use the Release Notes](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_included_release_notes.htm&release=244&type=5)

- [Preparing for the Release](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_other_resources.htm&release=244&type=5)

That second one will point you toward all the additional release resources as they go live: setting up your sandbox preview, finding the release’s Trailhead module, enrolling in the Release Readiness speaker series, and more!

And, if you’re curious how I conduct my release notes review — let’s do a little walk through. I generally do a sort of curated wander down the nav bar on the left side of the release notes page beginning, of course, with “[Salesforce Overall](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_general.htm&release=244&type=5)”/”[General Enhancements](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_general_enhancements.htm&language=en_US&release=244&type=5)” to get a feel for big, platform-wide improvements (and inevitably see where we stand in the countdown to MFA enforcement).

{{< image src="/img/1_uebLxCiao4joSFhqAoRucQ.png">}}

This section is typically very admin/partner-centered and, along with some updates to contract/product visibility it looks like we’ll be seeing:

- [New “Undo” Functionality](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_general_unsaved_changes.htm&release=244&type=5)

- [The Elimination of “News, Automated Account Fields, and Account Logos”](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_account_features_news_retirement.htm&release=244&type=5)

- [The Ability to “See Object Names in Record Tabs”](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_tab_name_object.htm&release=244&type=5)

Once I’m through the General Enhancements, I’ll continue down the left-hand NavBar to the subjects and products that directly affect my role, or any current projects and efforts. So in this case, I’m clicking into:

- [Analytics](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_analytics.htm&language=en_US&release=244&type=5)

- [Deployment](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_deployment.htm&release=244&type=5)

- [Development](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_development.htm&release=244&type=5)

- [Einstein](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_einstein.htm&release=244&type=5)

- [Experience Cloud](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_experiences.htm&release=244&type=5)

- [Industries](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_industries.htm&release=244&type=5)

- [Marketing](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_marketing.htm&release=244&type=5), of course

- and, [Sales Cloud](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_sales.htm&release=244&type=5)

Eventually, you’ll probably have a browser that’s jam-packed with tabs and looks a little something like this.

{{< image src="/img/1_TaIIQKiofjOiiWl4tLqvBQ.png">}}

And that’s why these round-ups and highlight posts are so important! Because we know most Trailblazers don’t have the time to read up on all the relevant updates in there. Heck, all those tabs aren’t even 1/3 of what’s in the Summer ’23 update! Those are just the ones that I hit on my first scan through for relevance.

So, please do let us know in the comments here if there’s a feature, product, or industry set you’re particularly interested in, stay tuned for our Release Highlights content and, if you’d like a more personalized 1-on-1 examination of which updates will have the biggets impact on your org, simply [drop us a line](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxConsultingListingDetail?listingId=a0N30000001gF9jEAE)! We’re always happy to help.

Until next time, keep working hard, smart, and happy. And we’ll see you in the cloud!

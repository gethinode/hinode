In the latest installment of our weekly informal-Salesforce-chat video series, Matt and Chris sit down to chat Salesforce Integrations, [Named &amp; External Credentials](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.nc_named_creds_and_ext_creds.htm&type=5), and some of the best practices surrounding communication between your Salesforce org and other platforms.

Matt also walks us through how to create an external credential and set up the connection. In laymen’s terms, we learn how to let Salesforce know it’s allowed to communicate with the external platform (and vice versa). In technical terms, we learn how to specify an authentication protocol and permission set or profile to use when authenticating to an external system — all through the Salesforce UI.
This really pulls the curtain back on what non-devs (like Chris) have assumed is a super code-heavy, complicated procedure!
Give it a watch and see how surprisingly straightforward it is for yourself! Of course, if you’d still like a hand getting your integration built or have other org needs that require a more experienced eye, [drop us a line](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxConsultingListingDetail?listingId=a0N30000001gF9jEAE)! We’re always happy to help.
And, until next time, keep working hard, smart, and happy. And we’ll see you in the cloud!

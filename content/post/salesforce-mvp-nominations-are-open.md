The [Salesforce “Golden Hoodie”](https://www.salesforce.com/blog/golden-hoodie-tradition-inspires/) is the most-coveted article of clothing in the Salesforce ecosystem and, potentially, the broader world of tech. If you’ve ever attended a Salesforce Community Event, [Dreamforce](http://wwww.dreamforce.com), TDX, etc… you’ve seen the way they sparkle and shine and, if you’ve ever met a Salesforce MVP, it doesn’t take long to tell exactly why they deserve such eye-catching garb!
Ever-helpful, exuberant, and enthusiastic, MVPs are those that best exemplify expertise, leadership, and generosity in the ecosystem. And now [nominations are open for 2024](https://nominations.salesforcemvps.com/s/start?language=en_US)!
If you know a Trailblazer, mentor, or product power-user / super-fan who embodies the values below, be sure to [nominate them](https://nominations.salesforcemvps.com/s/start?language=en_US) for next year’s MVP honors!

## Salesforce MVP Values

<ul><li><strong>Expertise: </strong>Salesforce MVPs maintain a strong understanding of Salesforce products and are eager to share their expertise through answering questions, authoring blogs, and more.</li><li><strong>Leadership:</strong> Salesforce MVPs lead Trailblazer Community Groups, help underprivileged communities skill up on Trailhead — Salesforce’s free online learning platform, and participate in programs like Salesforce MVP Office Hours and Community Conferences. Leadership also encompasses professional presence and how you show up in the Trailblazer Community, both in person and online.</li><li><strong>Generosity:</strong> Salesforce MVPs are the ultimate connectors and mentors. In addition to maintaining their Salesforce knowledge, they’re always willing to share insights, ideas, and connections to help others succeed.</li></ul>{{< image src="/img/1_Y9TsxoZftySJSEVx48mnQw.jpg" title="Image" >}}

Short and sweet is my motto this week. Hopefully it gives you a little break, cause last week was super full of fun events! So sit back, open up your calendar, and let’s get planning!
We are starting this week bright and early on Tuesday morning! At 7am (PT) on May 4th, Trailhead Live is hosting a [](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/live/broadcasts/a2r3k000001vCyp/trail-together---trees-to-combat-climate-change)**.** These sessions expose you to new or different badges, while doing them alongside you. This live session will teach those how to harness the power of trees in order to support the environment. I personally have already done this badge and it was very educational and inspiring!
Then at 11am (PT) Salesforce is hosting a [4](https://www.salesforce.com/form/events/webinars/form-rss/3101400) webinar. The speakers will unpack 4 secrets to deliver a connected, end-to-end digital customer journey. This is a great way to increase customer satisfaction and all of these tips will help you do so!
We have another event in the Salesforce Shared Discovery event series for partners! This week, from 10am to 10:30am (PT) on Thursday, May 6th [](https://shareddiscoverymay2021.splashthat.com/) wants to demonstrate how you can demo your apps customizable solutions to your buyers. This is all done in a preconfigured org too! Additionally, they will talk about converting more leads, reaching different audiences, and shortening your sales cycle.
Cryptocurrency: it’s everywhere now and everyone is talking about it, but what is it really and how does one get into that world? Well luckily for us, the Salesforce Women in Tech group of San Diego, CA is hosting [](https://trailblazercommunitygroups.com/events/details/salesforce-salesforce-women-in-tech-group-san-diego-united-states-presents-demystifying-cryptocurrency-how-to-get-started/) at 5pm (PT). The guest speaker and group leaders will help answer questions on how to get started in this world and give you access to resources, so that you may continue to learn about it! The guest speaker is the COO of a crypto wallet company that helps others manage Bitcoin, Monero, and more, so you know you are getting this info straight from the source!
For our last event of the week, well to be honest, it may or may not even happen. For those of you who remember, [](http://dreamole.es/) was supposed to occur last year in-person, but got pushed back to this year. Fast forward a year and now here we are, and according to the Salesforce event calendar, it’s still on for Friday, May 7th starting at 8am (Spain time) and in-person. There is even a countdown timer on the dreamOle site. However, the register now button states it’s for Spring 2022. Also, businesses, shops and restaurants still have limited seating and time constraints on them or are closed all together in Spain. So an event happening for almost 12 hours, in-person doesn’t seem likely to happen.… honestly I’m just as confused as you all are. Additionally, there is nothing that states that it’s been cancelled or is virtual this year. So I guess we will all be waiting with bated breath to find out if it’s happening this year or not. Tweet us [@mkpartners](http://www.twitter.com/mkpartners) and give us the 411 if you do know.

Last week we kicked off the week with a **Virtual Trailhead Taco Tuesday — April 2021**. The Los Angeles, CA Salesforce User group is notorious for Trailhead Taco Tuesday, and now they are bringing it to you virtually! Nonprofits learned how to capitalize on their website activity in **Optimize your Website for Insights, Personalization, &amp; Supporter Conversion.** We got to have a **B2B Marketing/Pardot User Group Happy Hour** hosted by the San Francisco Salesforce User group!
Last Thursday was jam packed with events! We started with **The Advertising Sales Equilibrium, Rebalanced **where speakers discussed the potential of AI to elevate a salesperson’s role, a cookieless future, how to tell a story right, how the CRO role is changing and the new sweet spot for advertising sales. Then in **Digital First Fundraising: Demo Jam**, Salesforce demoed new solutions to sustain funds and create resilience. Next, Indiana University and UMass Medical School talked about how they are tackling vaccine distribution in **Building Innovation: Vaccine Response In Higher Education.** The Salesforce Developer group in Austin, TX hosted **Straightforward Email Integration: Match My Emails vs. Einstein Activity Capture **to walk you through what type of email works for you.
Finally, the Colorado Springs, CO Salesforce User group hosted **The Wonderful Thing about Triggers** and was great for any admin to attend if they wanted to learn more about triggers! Tweet us [@mkpartners](http://www.twitter.com/mkpartners) and let us know what your favorite event was!

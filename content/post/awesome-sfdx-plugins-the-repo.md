Developing for [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/products/) is a key part of the platform’s powerful flexibility. On top of robust out-of-the-box functionality and seemingly-limitless configuration options, coding your own solutions to unique business-needs is what really elevates Salesforce above its competitors and makes it the most successful CRM in the world.

And, while there are a plethora of low and no-code options for customizing your org, nothing quite matches the freedom of envisioning, creating, and coding your own personally-perfect addition to the platform.

The [SFDX CLI](https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/sfdxcli) makes that easy — and an Ohana full of helpful trailblazing devs makes it even better! Between brainstorming sessions, brag-worthy showcases, clever code-tweaks, and fresh eyes for fixes, it seems there’s always someone out there to help you overcome whatever’s holding you up.

That helpful, creative genius isn’t limited to user-facing solutions, either. They’re also building things to make their own day-to-day development even easier. And yours too, with SFDX plugins!

One of the helpful voices you’ll stumble into regularly on your searches for solutions is [Shane McLaughlin](https://twitter.com/MShaneMc), Platform Architect at Salesforce and friend of SFDX users everywhere! Shane’s helpfully complied all of the most-handy open-source plugins for SFDX in his [Awesome Github repo](https://github.com/mshanemc/awesome-sfdx-plugins), so you can build out your developer toolbox and get more done with your time.

It’s a smorgasbord of shortcuts, tweaks, tools, and more to help developers get the job done. Featuring Shane’s [massive collection](https://github.com/mshanemc/shane-sfdx-plugins) of personal plugins and additions from a ton of other devs, it’s a repository full of time-savings that you’re welcome to use and contribute to!

[Here’s the link again](https://github.com/mshanemc/awesome-sfdx-plugins), so you can browse, “wow”, and `sfdx plugins:install` your faves! Drop your favorites in the comments below and don’t forget to thank Shane online, at Dreamforce, or the next Dev Conference!

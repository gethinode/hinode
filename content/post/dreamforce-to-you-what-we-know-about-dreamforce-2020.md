Dreamforce 2020 is kicking off next week and it'll be a big change from the Dreamforce we're used to as the event moves from the streets of San Francisco to computer screens all around the world!

[Registration is live](https://www.salesforce.com/dreamforce/) and there'll be a huge selection of virtual events, workshops, and talks to attend, presented both by Salesforce and the Trailblazer Community. More info's being released every day, so keep your eyes on the [DF page](https://www.salesforce.com/dreamforce/), [DF twitter](https://twitter.com/Dreamforce), [MK twitter](http://www.twitter.com/mkpartners), and here on the blog to stay in the loop.

And here's what we know so far!

So get those Trailblazer hoodies out of the closet and get ready for Dreamforce 2020!
Until then keep working hard, smart, and happy. And we’ll see you in the cloud.

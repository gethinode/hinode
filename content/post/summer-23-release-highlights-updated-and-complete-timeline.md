The biggest news this week isn’t **_[SUCCESSION SPOILER]_**, at least, not anymore. And that’s because we’ve gotten some updated info on the Salesforce Summer ’23 Release ! That’s right, Trailblazers everywhere will now know when to expect, well, everything!

Pre-Release Org-Signup, Release Note Reveal Day, when to expect the Summer ’23 Trailhead Module and more! Chris and Jessie sat down to discuss the updated info, start the countdown clocks, and get a bit more in-depth about what each step on the timeline means for admins everywhere!

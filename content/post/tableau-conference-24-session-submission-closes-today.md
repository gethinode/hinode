Ready to take the stage at TC24 and share your Analytics insights with the rest of the Datafam?! Well today’s the last day to submit those sessions for your chance to be selected!
That’s right, the submission portal closes today, February 12th, at 6pm Pacific so time’s ticking away fast to get submitted!
So don’t wait. They’ve got a page setup where you can [read tips on successful submissions](https://www.tableau.com/blog/tableau-conference-speakers-call-for-participation-tips), straight from the Tableau team, and then [head over to the portal](https://reg.salesforce.com/flow/plus/tc24/cfp/login?_ga=2.19121080.1685950131.1707777742-1627426254.1707170226) and use the time remaining to get your ideas for the perfect DataSesh in front of the review team!

Good luck, [happy submitting](https://reg.salesforce.com/flow/plus/tc24/cfp/login?_ga=2.19121080.1685950131.1707777742-1627426254.1707170226), and hopefully we’ll see you taking the stage in San Diego this Spring with the rest of the Datafam!
Until then, keep working hard, smart, and happy. We’ll see you in the cloud.

As a [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/) administrator, developer, or consultant, generating documents is likely an essential part of your users’ day-to-day tasks. However, not all document-generation apps are created equal. [Mambo Merge](https://www.mambomerge.com/) is a unique app doc-gen app in that it not only helps you (and your users) create professional docs, right from Salesforce with the push of a button, but also helps save your org time and effort with setup, maintenance, and support compared to the competition!

Unlike other apps that require custom configurations, additional objects, or mapped fields, Mambo Merge is straightforward to install on a sandbox, test, or production org. Simply download it from the [AppExchange](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/listingDetail?listingId=a0N3u00000MBinOEAT), add a component to a lighting page, and you’re good to go.

While many apps offer a trial period, few offer a free base tier. Offering a free edition drives interest and engagement, and connects with the Salesforce community. While it may not have all the features of a paid edition, it still helps generate more documents than many paid apps.

Creating the look and feel of each document can be expensive, but Mambo Merge provides the tools you need to create and revise documents without breaking the bank. And unlike other apps that make it difficult to make adjustments, Mambo Merge makes it easy to control your documents and revise them as many times as you need.

Other apps require data to leave Salesforce in order to generate documents, but Mambo Merge is 100% native within Salesforce, which means that every document generated does not require any data to leave your org. This keeps your security protocols intact and eliminates the need for additional security measures when generating documents.

Other apps only solve problems within their scope, Mambo Merge thrives on new opportunities to expand its functionality. Many of Mambo Merge’s most-celebrated features are the results of solutions being built for clients’ unique use cases! New functionality is always being developed and the feature list continues to grow, and we encourage clients to share new challenges or ideas we can build towards to enhance the feature set.

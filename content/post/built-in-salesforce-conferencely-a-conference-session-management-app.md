All those little “**wouldn’t-it-be-nice”**s and “**I-sure-wish-we-had-a…**”s become “**I-think-I’ll-build**”s and “**I-know-what-I’m-making-next**”s once you get comfortable on the platform! I know my personal Trailhead org (and a few dev orgs) play host to some of my favorite built-in-my-free-time apps: my Dungeons and Dragons Character Sheet Builder, March Madness Bracket Manager, Closet/Wardrobe Tracker, Hobby Tracker, and more! In fact, at this point I’ve likely learned more about the platform building my personal time-savers than I have from Trailhead-proper, so it’s a double-valuable endeavor!
And, to show you just how fun and easy it is to go from “back of the napkin” to “live in (a dev) org”, in this edition of **Built in Salesforce**, I sat down with Matt to chat about his recent wish fulfillment build — Conferencly: an app to handle event agenda management, session tracking, and more!

In it you’ll see not only how quickly you can go from idea to implementation, but also how easy it is to keep developing ideas for improvement once you’re looking at an in-org proof of concept!
Then, let us know in the comments what you’d love to see built in Salesforce so we can tackle it next— or go build it yourself in your own Trailhead or Dev org and come back here to show it off! We can’t wait to see what you come up with.
Until next time, keep working hard, smart, and happy! And we’ll see you in the cloud!

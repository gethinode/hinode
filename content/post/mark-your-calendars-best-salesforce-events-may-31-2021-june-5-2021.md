We have a very short week ahead of us, probably due to the Memorial Day holiday in the United States or maybe because everyone is getting those summer feels and just want to be out and about! So sit back, open up your calendar, and let’s get planning!

The main attraction of the week is on Wednesday, June 2nd and starts at 9am (PT). [Connections 2021](https://www.salesforce.com/connections/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=event&utm_campaign=sfevent-amer-all---cnx-&utm_content=-o1-invite--&nc=7013y000002Ys0vAAC&d=7013y000002Ys0yAAC&utm_medium=email&) is back (virtually) and will be partially live, and on-demand! This event is for marketers, commerce professionals, and digital leaders to learn more about new and upcoming experiences in the Salesforce ecosystem. The event will kick off with a keynote speech from Sarah Franklin and Trailblazers, then transition to a jam soul session with Leon Bridges, and then break out into interactive learning sessions! These interactive learning sessions will consist of the usual Q&A sessions, product demonstrations, and live discussions. This is a great event for you to network and connect with others on the platform (and they even recommend doing it on Twitter too). Also, if you head over to their Episode page, you’ll get a sneak peek of the content to come! The videos are separated into playlists by topics, making it easier for you to navigate the site.

If you would like to join a watch party for Connections 2021, two groups, the [San Diego Salesforce User group](https://trailblazercommunitygroups.com/events/details/salesforce-salesforce-user-group-san-diego-united-states-presents-salesforce-connections-2021-watch-party/) and the [San Francisco Salesforce Marketer group](https://trailblazercommunitygroups.com/events/details/salesforce-salesforce-marketer-group-marketing-cloud-san-francisco-united-states-presents-salesforce-connections-2021-watch-party/), are both hosting ones! Both are kicking off at 8:45am and ending around 10am, as they are both doing the watch party just for the keynote speech.

The only other event occurring this week is [A Tale of Digital Transformation to Rescue Millions by 2030](https://www.salesforce.com/form/sfdo/ngo/a-tale-of-digital-transformation/?_ga=2.162219193.466341366.1622133279-219845214.1586544338). On Thursday, June 3rd at 11am (PT), Salesforce will be joined by the International Justice Mission (IJM) to talk about how they rallied global societies to invest in and reform justice systems in poorer areas of the world. IJM needed technology to make this happen and their Chief Information Officer will be sharing how Salesforce helped them get closer to achieving their 2030 vision.

## Recap

Last week we learned how to _Eliminate the Guesswork From Your Sales Forecast_, which gave viewers tips on how to make sales faster, easier, and more accurate! The Salesforce Developer group of Irvine, Ca had their first in-person event, _Seeing Friendly Faces — an In-Person Parkside Chat_, at the Marina park in Newport Beach! Did the sunset deliver? In _How to Attract, Grow, and Retain Customers Through Artificial Intelligence_ and Machine Learning Applications viewers learned how to convert leads based on propensity to buy profile, increase lending profile with white space analysis, drive next-level customer care and reduce attrition, and anticipate asks for member service based on a customer journey.

I attended _What a Year — Let’s Talk about Mental Health_ with Dr. Kim Norman, who talked about how generosity and giving back to the community can give employees a sense of purpose and happiness. The San Francisco, CA Salesforce Marketer (Pardot) group hosted a _B2B Marketing/ Pardot User Group Virtual Happy Hour_! Then we ended the week in the UK learning about _Matching the Digital Expectations of Clients: How You Can Avoid Program Interruptions_ where viewers learned how organizations can transition to meet program participant’s needs when in-person services are limited and communities’ needs are changing. Tweet us [@mkpartners](https://twitter.com/mkpartners) and let us know what your favorite event was!

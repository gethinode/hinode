Formed and fostered by a fairly unmatched-elsewhere combination: a talented, helpful, and almost endlessly supportive userbase and an organization that truly celebrates and supports its most generous and helpful users. The celebration of Salesforce MVPs is a great example of that!

And, with this year’s announcements of our new MVPs, renewed MVPs, and MVP Hall of Fame inductees, the number of MVPs (in the current [MVP Directory](https://go.mkp.dev/MVPDirectory)) is 198.

We’re only 2 away from MVP 200!

To put that in perspective. With [20,000,000 people](https://go.mkp.dev/SFFacts) in the Trailblazer Community that means Salesforce MVPs are a super rare **0.001%**.

I feel like small percentages sometimes get weirdly hard to comprehend until you flip them, so let’s! To be a Salesforce MVP means to be juuuust above **99.999%** in terms of generosity, leadership, helpfulness, expertise. That’s incredible!

Before we speculate on who will take the 200th spot, let’s meet 2024’s newest members!

## This Year’s Renewals

You have to renew as a Salesforce MVP? Interestingly, Salesforce MVP-ships aren’t guaranteed forever, or renewed automatically.
Officially, “Salesforce MVPs are only eligible for renewal if they demonstrate the following throughout the year: continued leadership, expertise, generosity, engagement, and professional presence in both the Trailblazer Community and their local communities.” and that renewed members. “…go through the same evaluation process as the new class”.

If you’ve ever been to a Salesforce event (or online space), some of their names and faces will, no doubt, be familiar to you.

## What about Salesforce MVP number 200?

It looks like we’ll be crowning our 200th Salesforce MVP with the class of 2025! I guess that technically it depends on the number of renewals, but it seems very likely!

Will it be the head of your local user group, the new admin in your office, or how about you?!

Salesforce MVP nominations will open up later this year (typically in Oct/Nov) and that’ll be your chance to submit the people that’ve helped and supported you the most, both on and off the platform.

We will, of course, post when nominations open, so stay tuned here and you won’t miss your chance to toss someone’s hat into the ring! And, in the meantime, feel free to make your siggestions for the 200th Salesforce MVP right here in the comments!

Until next time, keep working hard, smart, and happy.

And we’ll see you in the cloud.

Dreamforce has been burning a hole in our calendars all year and, while we found out fairly early on that this year's circumstances will require the first ever virtual incarnation of the event, additional news about what to expect has been pretty slim. But there's some big news on the horizon!

We're not quuuuite at liberty to share the details yet, but you'll definitely want to keep an eye on the [Dreamforce twitter account](http://www.twitter.com/dreamforce) over the next few days for their announcement and, of course, check back here for our post-announcement update and breakdown of what it all means for us, the Salesforce Community.

We're also expecting a fairly hefty update to the [Dreamforce FAQs](https://www.salesforce.com/dreamforce/faq/), so those might be worth bookmarking to save you some searching in the coming weeks. After all, Dreamforce is less than a month away!

Until the big reveal, keep working hard, smart, and happy --- and we'll see you in the cloud.

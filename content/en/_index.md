A site that is dedicated to sharing some of the stuff that I like. At the moment, also a site that is under development and to which still quite some content needs to be added.  
I happen to like numerous things, but in this case what I will write about and share is mostly about developing this site, my electronics and software projects, and photography.

The most recent topics can be found in the below sections and all information can be accessed by navigating the menu above.  
If you are interested in who I am and why this site is named Myrthos, hit the About button below.

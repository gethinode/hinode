The core of this site is based on the [Hinode](https://github.com/gethinode/hinode) theme for Hugo, which was created by Mark Dumay. It is an excellent template and Mark is also very supportive. A demo of the Hinode template can be found [here](https://demo.gethinode.com/en/).

The image gallery uses [Lightbox 2](https://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/), made by Lokesh Dhakar.  
The image gallery shortcode I made, was at the very beginning based on the code of [Cristian Specht](https://christianspecht.de/2023/03/18/hugo-lightbox-image-gallery-renaming-processed-images/). It has changed a lot since then, but if his shortcode offers you exactly what you wanted, use that one instead of the far more complicated (but also more versatile) version I made.

<!-- CSpell:ignore Florian Klauer Hinode Dumay Lightbox Lokesh Dhakar shortcode Cristian Specht lastmod -->

The core of this site is based on the {{< link "https://github.com/gethinode/hinode" >}}Hinode{{< /link >}} theme for Hugo, which was created by Mark Dumay. It is an excellent theme and Mark is also very supportive. A demo of the Hinode template can be found {{< link "https://demo.gethinode.com/en" >}}here{{< /link >}}.

The image gallery uses {{< link "https://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/" >}}Lightbox 2{{< /link>}}, made by Lokesh Dhakar.  
The image gallery shortcode I made, was at the very beginning based on the code of {{< link "https://christianspecht.de/2023/03/18/hugo-lightbox-image-gallery-renaming-processed-images/" >}}Cristian Specht{{< /link >}}. It has changed a lot since then, but if his shortcode offers you exactly what you wanted, use that one instead of the far more complicated (but also more versatile) version I made.

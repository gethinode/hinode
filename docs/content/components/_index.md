        Hinode uses [Hugo shortcodes](https://gohugo.io/shortcodes/) to quickly
        add interactive elements to your site. Hinodes supports more than 30
        components, powered by [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com),
        [Lottie](http://airbnb.io/lottie/), [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/),
        and other popular libraries. Click on a card for more details about
        a component, including available arguments.

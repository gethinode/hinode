      Type of script bundle. Critical scripts are included in the page header
      and are loaded immediately. Core scripts are bundled by category and are
      loaded asynchronously. Optional scripts are loaded individually on the
      pages that require them. They use the synchronization method as defined
      in their containing module.
    values:
      - critical
      - core

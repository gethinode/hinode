  Render a local or remote image with responsive image sizing. Images are
  resized using default media breakpoints and are converted to webp format. The
  image is processed using the quality setting specified in the [imaging]
  section of the main config file (defaults to 75). A fallback image is provided
  for older browsers. The image is wrapped in a figure if a caption is provided,
  else the image is wrapped in a div with a ratio constraint.
  
  If the url starts with `http`, the image is retrieved from an external
  location. Else, the url is matched with a page resource and site asset (in
  that order). The path of a remote image is rewritten to ensure processed files
  are stored in the final '/img' folder. 
  
  The partial supports the following bitmap image formats: `png`, `jpeg`, `gif`,
  `tiff`, `bmp`, and  `webp`. Vector graphics of type `svg` are supported too,
  although these images do no support additional processing. This means the
  arguments `ratio` and `portrait` have no effect for vector images. Vector
  graphics support an optional anchor `#` in their url to denote a symbol
  reference.
arguments:
  url:
    type:
      - string
      - template.URL
    optional: true
    comment: >-
      Path or url of the image, e.g. `img/example.jpg`. Images with multiple
      color modes are expected to have a basename that ends with either `-dark`
      or `-light`.
  src:
    type: string
    optional: true
    position: 0

  page:

  mode:
    type: bool
    default: false
    optional: true
    comment: >-
      Flag indicating if the image should support color modes. If set, the
      shortcode searches for images that having a matching color-mode suffix
      such as `-light` or `-dark`.
  ratio:
    type: select
    optional: true
    comment: >-
      Ratio of the image. If set, the image is resized and cropped to match the
      ratio. Else the original aspect ratio of the image is kept. Not applicable
      to vector graphics.
    options:
      values:
        - 1x1
        - 3x2
        - 4x3
        - 16x9
        - 21x9
  portrait:
    type: bool
    optional: true
    default: false
    comment: >-
      Flag to adjust the ratio from landscape to portrait. The image itself is
      not rotated, only the crop area is adjusted. Not applicable to vector
      graphics.

      Loading behavior of the image. The loading of lazily loaded images is
      deferred until the image is within scrolling range of the viewport. This
      should reduce the initial loading time of the website. It is recommended
      to lazily load only those images that are below the pagefold.
    options:
      values:
        - eager
        - lazy
    release: v0.21.0
  priority:
    type: select
    default: auto
    optional: true
    comment: >-
      Fetch priority of the image. The priority provides a hint to the browser
      on how it should prioritize the fetching of the image relative to other
      images. The implementation is experimental and currently only supported by
      Chrome, Edge, and Opera.
    options:
      values:
        - high
        - low
        - auto

  sizes:
    type: string

      One or more strings separated by commas, indicating the source sizes of an
      image set.

    optional: true
    comment:
      Flag to indicate if the image should render a plain image instead of an
      image set. When set, no transformations are applied to the image.
    release: v0.24.0

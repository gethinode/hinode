  Includes a reference to a local or external JavaScript file. Hinode uses the
  template defined in `layouts/partials/templates/script.html` to generate the
  link to a (bundled) JavaScript file. It includes context such as the state,
  category, and integrity. For example, you can adapt this template to implement
  cookie consent management.
arguments:
  link:
    type: string
    optional: false

      Location of the script source, either an URL for an external script or a
      (relative) path for a local script.

      Defines the loading behavior of the script bundle. By default, scripts are
      loaded immediately. Use `async` to process the script in the background.
      Use `defer` to load the script in relative order when the DOM is fully
      built.
    options:
      values:
        - async
        - defer
        - immediate
  category:
    type: select
    optional: true
    default: other

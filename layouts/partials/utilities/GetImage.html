<!-- 
    Retrieve a local or remote resource compatible with Hugo's image processing. If the url starts with 'http', the
    image is retrieved from an external location. Else, the url is matched with a page resource and site asset (in that
    order). The path of a remote image is rewritten to ensure processed files are stored in the final '/img' folder. The
    partial returns nil if the resource cannot be found or is incompatibile. The partial supports the following
    arguments:
    "url"           Required path or url of the image, e.g. "img/example.jpg" or "https://example.com/img.jpg"
    "page"          Optional page context, used to retrieve an image from page resources.

# About this site

This the repository for [myrthos.net](https://myrthos.net). It is a site that is still in development to outgrow its infancy.

The site is intended to be used as my playground, where I post blogs, write about projects, create documentation and show photo's about the things that interest me.

It is a [Hugo][hugo] site that uses the [Hinode][repository] theme with some modifications.

Although based on a Hugo theme, this repository is not developed to be used as a Hugo theme. It is a modified version of the Hinode theme and developed as a specific implementation, with all the deviations and additions described in a blog post. If you are looking for a theme, you are much better of using Hinode, as that is supported.  
Detailed information about Hinode is available on the [official website][website].

The Myrthos site scores an A+ on [Mozilla Observatory][observatory], an A+ on [SSL Labs][ssllabs] and 99% on [pageSpeed][pagespeed] (98% for mobile).

## Prerequisites

Hinode requires [Git][git_download], [Node.js][nodejs] and [npm][npm], and so does this repository. It also requires [bootstrap][bootstrap] (which is installed automatically).
